What is VA FileMan?

VA FileMan is the database management system for the Veterans Health
Information Systems and Technology Architecture user (VistA)
environment. VA FileMan creates and maintains a database management
system that includes features such as:

-   A report writer

-   A data dictionary manager

-   Scrolling and screen-oriented data entry

-   Text editors

-   Programming utilities

-   Tools for sending data to other systems

-   File archiving

VA FileMan can be used as a:

-   Standalone database

-   Set of interactive or "silent" routines

-   Set of application utilities

In all modes, it is used to define, enter, and retrieve information from
a set of computer-stored files, each of which is described by a data
dictionary.

VA FileMan is a public domain software package that is developed and
maintained by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It is widely used
by VA medical centers and in clinical, administrative, and business
settings in this country and abroad.

![](output/images/media/image3.png) CAUTION: Programmer access in VistA
is defined as DUZ(0)="@". It grants the privilege to become a developer
in VistA. Programmer access allows you to work outside many of the
security controls enforced by VA FileMan, enables access to all VA
FileMan files, access to modify data dictionaries, etc. It is important
to proceed with caution when having access to the system in this way.

How to Use this Manual

The VA FileMan User Manual is comprised of two separate documents that
describe the VA FileMan functionality of VistA's database management
system:

-   The *VA FileMan User Manual* (this manual) introduces basic VA
    FileMan concepts, and shows you how to use VA FileMan's basic tools
    for displaying and editing data. It shows you how to use VA FileMan
    features that are used throughout most VistA applications and used
    by *all* VistA users.

-   The *VA FileMan Advanced User Manual* shows how to use the features
    of VA FileMan that are likely to be used by experienced VistA users.
    It introduces advanced VA FileMan concepts, and shows you how to use
    VA FileMan's advanced tools. It describes features that are more
    likely to be used by:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Automated Data Processing Application Coordinators (ADPACs)

-   System Administrators

-   Other technical users

in Microsoft Word (.docx), Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF),
and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format (see the "[HTML
Manuals](#html_manuals)" section).

In this manual, the following major features of VA FileMan are
introduced along with a description on how to use them:

the VistA environment see the *VA FileMan Installation Guide* and any
national patch description of the patch being released.

[]{#html_manuals .anchor}HTML Manuals

Why produce an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) edition of the VA
FileMan manuals?

-   The HTML versions of the VA FileMan manuals are useful as online
    documentation support as you use VA FileMan. HTML manuals allow you
    to instantly jump (link) to specific sections, other documents, or
    references online.

-   The VA FileMan HTML manuals are "living" documents that are
    continuously updated with the most current VA FileMan information
    (unlike paper or printed documentation). They are updated based on
    new versions, patches, or enhancements to VA FileMan.

-   Presenting manuals in an HTML format online also gives new
    opportunities, such as accessing embedded multimedia training
    material (e.g.,Â movies, audio recordings, etc.) directly in the
    manuals.

-   Manuals are accessible over the VA Intranet network.

Intended Audience

The intended audience of this manual is all key stakeholders. The
stakeholders include the following:

-   General users of the VA FileMan database.

-   Automated Data Processing Application Coordinators (ADPACs)

-   System Administrators---Personnel at Department of Veterans Affairs
    (VA) sites who are responsible for computer management and system
    security on the VistA M Servers.

-   Enterprise Program Management Office (EPMO)---VistA legacy
    development teams.

-   Product Support (PS).

# Introduction

## Fields, Records, and Files

A computer database, such as VA FileMan, organizes your data, storing it
in fields, records, and files, much as you might arrange and preserve
information on paper.

A *record* is a group of fields of data. Each record has a name (e.g.,Â a
patient name for a patient record). You can use the record name to
recall the record for editing or for printing out. Records are also
known as file *entries*.

For example, a record for a patient might have various fields
(e.g.,Â NAME, AGE, ADMISSION DATE, etc.) for a single patient. Each
record for a patient would contain the same set of fields (places to
fill in information):

[]{#_Toc527389205 .anchor}Figure : Example Showing Several Patient
Records

![Example showing several patient records. Image shows: Box: Individual
fields within a record \--\> pointint to multiple (3) boxes representing
patient
records.](output/images/media/image6.png "Example Showing Several Patient Records"){width="5.84375in"
height="3.4895833333333335in"}

Each *field* in a record functions just like a blank on a form. When you
are editing a record on a terminal, for each field, you get a prompt
that tells you what type of data to enter.

VA FileMan uses **16** basic [field types](#field-types). These fields
allow you to enter only certain kinds of information, just as a blank on
a form might require you to enter only numbers. For example:

-   A DATE OF BIRTH field could be set up to record dates/times.

-   A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER field could be set up to record a
    **nine**-digit number.

-   An ADDRESS field could be set up to hold the text of an address.

These three fields are different from one another because of the type of
data they store.

All of the records that contain like data are collected and stored in
the same *file*. For example, all patient records are stored in the
PATIENT (#2) file and all computer user records are stored in the NEW
PERSON (#200) file. This way, to look up a patient, you know that the
file to go to is the PATIENT (#2) file. Also, to do a report on all
patients, you would generate the report from the PATIENT (#2) file.

## Files and the Database

The *database* contains all the data files on your computer system:

[]{#_Toc527389206 .anchor}Figure : Representation of a Database

![Representation of a database. Circle with \"Database\" at the top.
within the circle are several boxes representing files: Patinet File,
Prescription File, Blood Bank File, Order File, Scheduling File,
Provider File, Hospital Locations File, Employee
File](output/images/media/image7.png "Representation of a Database"){width="6.197916666666667in"
height="5.958333333333333in"}

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** There are many more files than this in
VistA databases!

## Printing Records from Files

One way of getting at the information stored in a database is to
generate reports that print out selected records. You do *not* have to
print *every* field in a record; you can just choose a subset of fields
to print out. Nor do you have to print *every* record in a file; there
are ways to limit and select what records to print out.

The report in [Figure 3]{.underline} displays four records, with one
line of output per record, from the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file:

[]{#_Ref389660359 .anchor}Figure : Example of a Printed Report

Internal Entry

Number Name Title

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-- \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

1 ICU Intensive Care Unit

2 CCU Critical Care Unit

5 OR Operating Room

25 1EAST Ward on 1 East

Most applications that use VA FileMan provide a number of already-set-up
reports you can quickly choose and print out. In addition, there are
options in VA FileMan that allow you to generate your own reports.

This manual contains the following sections on print records from the
database:

-   [Inquire]{.underline}

-   [Print]{.underline}

-   [Search]{.underline}

-   [Browser]{.underline}

## Adding and Editing Records

As well as printing records from the database, you can *add* new records
and *edit* existing records. When you work on the computer system with
VistA applications (e.g.,Â Laboratory) most of what you are doing is
adding new records and editing existing ones. For example, each new lab
result would get stored in a new record; when you make a status change
it would be an edit to a field or fields in a patient's existing record.

Since the bulk of the work you do on the computer system involves
working with records, the more you know about using the underlying
database system (VA FileMan), the easier it is to do all of your work on
the computer system.

This manual contains the following sections on how to edit information
in records:

-   [VA FileMan Prompts]{.underline}

-   [Field Types]{.underline}

-   [Adding and Deleting Records]{.underline}

-   [ScreenMan]{.underline} (editing via forms)

-   [Word-Processing Fields]{.underline}

-   [Screen Editor]{.underline} (WORD-PROCESSING fields)

-   [Line Editor]{.underline} (WORD-PROCESSING fields)

## LAYGO File Access

In VistA applications, you *not* only display and edit existing records,
but also add and delete records from files. For example, you might need
to add a new patient to the PATIENT (#2) file. The access to add and
delete records can be controlled; however, each VA FileMan file can be
set to either allow or *not* allow adding and deleting of new records.

If a file allows records to be added or deleted, it is said to have
**Learn-As-You-Go** (**LAYGO**) access. To add or delete records, your
user account *must* also be set to allow **LAYGO** access to the file in
question. For example, there are certain conditions when you need to
specify a particular physician. At that point, you can enter a new
physician name, rather than choosing one that already is on file. If you
are allowed to add new entries to the file (i.e.,Â you have **LAYGO**
access), the new entry is added to a file of physicians.

## Scrolling Mode vs. Screen Mode

Many VA VistA application packages have a *Scrolling Mode* interface.
Scrolling Mode works as follows:

1.  Computer puts a prompt on the screen.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
10. Users enter a response to the prompt.

11. Computer places another prompt on the screen, scrolling down one
    line. Previous prompts move up and eventually off of the screen.

In Scrolling Mode, prompting occurs in the same predetermined order, in
a sequence designed by the developer of the application. The user
enters, and the computer stores, the responses one at a time. Unless the
user is familiar with a few timesaving Scrolling Mode techniques, the
user has to step through each prompt in a record before he/she can
finish editing the record.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information on editing records in
Scrolling Mode, see the "[VA FileMan Prompts]{.underline}" section.

Recently developed VistA applications, on the other hand, often use a
*Screen Mode* interface for editing data. In the Screen Mode approach,
each field occupies a fixed position on the screen. The user can see
many data fields at once and use simple key combinations to edit data
and move from field to field on a screen. The user can also move from
one screen to another like turning through the pages of a book. VA
FileMan's screen-oriented data entry tool is called
[ScreenMan]{.underline}.

In comparing Scrolling Mode with Screen Mode, an area in particular
where Screen Mode is much more convenient than Scrolling Mode is text
editing. VA FileMan's Scrolling Mode text editor is the [Line
Editor]{.underline}. A better choice for editing text is VA FileMan's
Screen Mode editor, the [Screen Editor]{.underline}.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information on the Line Editor, see
the "[Line Editor]{.underline}" section. For more information on the
Screen Editor, see the "[Screen Editor]{.underline}" section.

# Inquire

## Overview

Many reports that you print from applications are pre-designed
(i.e.,Â the selection of records) and the fields that print for each
record are pre-determined by the application developer. You simply
choose the report you would like to print from a menu option, choose an
output device, and the selected report prints.

You can also create your own reports, however, if you have either VA
FileMan's print options, or custom-designed application options that
take advantage of the same VA FileMan features. This section introduces
one of VA FileMan's print options, **Inquire to File Entries**
\[DIINQUIRE\] option.

There are two ways you have an opportunity to use VA FileMan's inquiry
capabilities:

-   An option that has been set up already to allow you to inquire to
    entries from a particular file.

-   VA FileMan's **Inquire to File Entries** \[DIINQUIRE\] option, which
    lets you inquire to any file to which you have access.

In either case, use of VA FileMan's inquire feature is very similar. In
most cases, the only difference is that with the **Inquire to File
Entries** \[DIINQUIRE\] option, you have to choose which file to
inquire.

## Inquire to File Entries Option

The quickest way to display the data for one file entry or for a small
number of entries is to use the **Inquire to File Entries**
\[DIINQUIRE\] option. This option lets you choose a set of entries to
display, and choose the fields that you want to see for each entry. For
example:

[]{#_Toc527389208 .anchor}Figure : Inquire---Dialogue Using the Inquire

### Standard Caption Output

Choosing Standard Captioned Output can be very useful; it prints out
*all* fields (that contain data) for each entry in the report. Use it is
a quick way to select all the fields for each entry in the report.
Otherwise, you need to select each field to print individually, from the
list of fields available to print in the file. Answering **YES** to use
STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT is the fastest way to choose what fields to
print.

#### Computed Fields

When using Standard Captioned Output, you can choose from the following
at the "Include COMPUTED Fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO//" prompt:

-   **N (default)---**NO - No record number (IEN), no Computed Fields

-   **Y---**Computed Fields

-   **R---**Record Number (IEN)

-   **B---**BOTH Computed Fields and Record Number (IEN)

The default is to display neither. Enter two question marks (**??**) for
detailed help about responding to this prompt.

#### Audit Trails

If one or more of the fields have been audited, the system displays the
"DISPLAY AUDIT TRAIL?" prompt. If you answer **YES**, then you see the
changes that have been recorded for the various fields in the AUDIT
(#1.1) file, along with the current values of the fields.

## SORT Templates

When you choose several entries to display, you are prompted with the
following:

[]{#_Toc527389209 .anchor}Figure : Inquire---Prompt to Store Entries
into a Template

STORE THESE ENTRY ID's IN A TEMPLATE:

You can *save* your list of selected entries in a SORT template by
entering a template name at this prompt. Your list of entries is then
saved in a SORT template. You can then *reuse* the list of selected
entries in the template when you do additional printing from this file
in the future.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information on using SORT
templates, see the "[Saving Sort Criteria (SORT Templates)]{.underline}"
section.

## Choose Your Own Print Fields

![](output/images/media/image3.png) CAUTION: Do *not* use STANDARD
CAPTIONED OUTPUT.

To choose your own fields to output for each entry, answer **NO** to the
"STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT?" prompt. You can then choose your own output
fields. For example, if you only need NAME, DATE OF BIRTH, and PROVIDER
information about a selected patient, you could request it, as shown in
[Figure 6]{.underline}:

print fields, see the "[Print]{.underline}" section. It provides
detailed information about the different choices you can make at the
"PRINT FIELD:" prompt to display your information in different ways.

## Choose Your Own Device

![](output/images/media/image3.png) CAUTION: Do *not* use STANDARD
CAPTIONED OUTPUT.

If you enter **YES** at the "STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT?" prompt, output
is sent to the **HOME** device, which ordinarily is the terminal you are
using. To send output to a printer, you need to answer **NO** at the
"STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT?" prompt. This means you *must* choose your
own print fields, as described in Section [2.4]{.underline}, "[Choose
Your Own Print Fields]{.underline}." Doing this allows you to select the
output device, however.

If you answer **NO** to the "STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT?" prompt, you can
still get CAPTIONED output, however. To do this, choose the CAPTIONED
PRINT template at the first "PRINT FIELD:" prompt, as shown in [Figure
7]{.underline}.

Enter a left bracket "**\[**" and the word **CAPTIONED**. CAPTIONED
OUTPUT from the template works exactly as if you had answered **YES** at
the "STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT?" prompt to request CAPTIONED OUTPUT.

## How to Print Reports from Files

With the **Inquire to File Entries** \[DIINQUIRE\] option, you can:

1.  Select entries from a file, one by one.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
12. Choose a format for displaying the selected entries.

13. Output the selected entries.

VA FileMan's print capabilities, on the other hand, allow you to select
entries, *not* one by one, but instead by choosing a range of entries
based on the sorting order. You can choose all entries in a file, for
example, and sort them in alphabetical order for the printout.
Alternatively, you can choose all entries sorting between **E** and
**F** and sort them in alphabetical order for the printout.

## VA FileMan's Print Capabilities

There are two ways in which you have an opportunity to use VA FileMan's
print capabilities:

-   An option that has been set up already to allow you to print from a
    particular file.

-   VA FileMan's **Print File Entries** \[DIPRINT\] option, which lets
    you print from any file to which you have access.

In either case, use of VA FileMan's print features is very similar. In
most cases, the only difference is that with the **Print File Entries**
\[DIPRINT\], you have to choose from which file to print.

Unlike the **Inquire to File Entries** \[DIINQUIRE\] option, which
displays individual records, VA FileMan's print can list all records in
a file. Thus, the focus of the **Inquire to File Entries** \[DIINQUIRE\]
option is a single or small group of entries while VA FileMan's prints
are concerned with the entire file.

VA FileMan's print features allow considerable flexibility in:

-   Selecting entries.

-   Ordering (or sorting) the entries selected.

-   Choosing which fields to display.

-   Formatting the output.

The following two basic components can be used to create a report:

-   "SORT BY:" dialogue. Used to sort (and sometimes narrow down) the
    entries that you want displayed.

-   "PRINT FIELD:" dialogue. Used to choose the fields you want and the
    format of their display.

The choices you can make at these two prompts are discussed in detail
later in this section.

## Standard Column Format for VA FileMan Prints

VA FileMan has a standard, columnar format for print output. The file
name, current date/time, and page number appear at the top of each
report page, followed by column headings that correspond to the labels
of selected fields. There are many ways to customize the format, as
shown in [Figure 8]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref446146148 .anchor}Figure : Print---Example of a Standard
Printout

PATIENT LIST NOV 28, 1996 11:32 PAGE 1

FMPATIENT,SEVEN MALE

FMPATIENT,EIGHT MALE

FMPATIENT,NINE MALE

FMPATIENT,10 FEMALE

This simple example of a report ([Figure 8]{.underline}) is generated by
the dialogue in [Figure 9]{.underline}. It prints information from all
the entries in the PATIENT (#2) file, ordered by NAME (#.01) field. Only
data from the NAME and SEX fields are printed, as requested at the
"PRINT FIELD:" prompts:

[]{#_Ref345588318 .anchor}Figure : Print---Dialogue for Creating a

THEN PRINT FIELD:

DEVICE:

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** You would have received information about
every patient in the file, *not* just these four. You could have asked
for several more fields to be printed. They would appear as columns of
output, left to right, in the order specified.

## Sorting

### Specifying SORT BY Fields

Sorting determines the *order* that records are printed in your reports.
You can accept the default order (by the **.01** field), or you can
specify your own sorting order. The sort can be a simple sort, based on
only one field, or you can sort based on the values of several fields.

For example, if you want to print the entries in order from oldest to
youngest patient, you could sort the report by date of birth (the DATE
OF BIRTH field in the PATIENT \[#2\] file), as shown in [Figure
10]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref345588324 .anchor}Figure : Print---Dialogue for Specifying a
Sort Order for a Printed Report: Sample User Entries at Prompts

Select VA FileMan Option: **PRINT \<Enter\>** File Entries

OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: PATIENT// **\<Enter\>**

SORT BY: NAME// **DATE OF BIRTH**

START WITH DATE OF BIRTH: FIRST// **\<Enter\>**

WITHIN DATE OF BIRTH, SORT BY: **\<Enter\>**

FIRST PRINT FIELD: **NAME**

1 NAME

2 NAME COMPONENTS

3 NAME ORDER

CHOOSE 1-3: **1 \<Enter\>** NAME

THEN PRINT FIELD: **SEX**

THEN PRINT FIELD: **\<Enter\>**

Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// **\<Enter\>**

DEVICE: **\<Enter\>** SSH VIRTUAL TERMINAL Right Margin: 80//
**\<Enter\>**

The output then prints in the following order (by DATE OF BIRTH), as
shown in [Figure 11]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref490833751 .anchor}Figure : Print---Example of a Printed Report
in a Specific Order

PATIENT LIST FEB 12, 2013 19:11 PAGE 1

NAME SEX

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

DATE OF BIRTH: OCT 14, 1877

FMPATIENT,12 FEMALE

DATE OF BIRTH: NOV 3, 1922

FMPATIENT,13 MALE

DATE OF BIRTH: APR 4, 1933

FMPATIENT,NINE MALE

If you sort by a field that is *not* a print field, then it is displayed
as a subheader. In [Figure 11]{.underline}, the sort criterion (DATE OF
BIRTH) is printed as a subheader with every change in sort value.

To suppress the printing of sort values (subheaders) in the body of your
report, you can either:

-   Add the field you are sorting by to the print field list.

-   Place an at-sign (**@**) in front of the field label at the "SORT
    BY:" prompt. In the previous example ([Figure 11]{.underline}), you
    would sort by **\@DATE OF BIRTH** instead of **DATE OF BIRTH**.

### Sorting Order

The ordering of entries within a sort is generally from low value to
high value. Some special cases for specific data type field values
include:

-   **SET OF CO****DES---**Field values are sorted by the internally
    stored code, *not* the value that is output.

-   **FREE TEXT---**Field values usually sort from lowest value to
    highest value following the ASCII sorting sequence. Digits sort
    before uppercase letters, which sort before lowercase letters
    (e.g.,Â **M1** sorts before **MC** which sorts before **Mc**).

#### Sorting Canonic Numbers and *Non*-Canonic Strings, and the ;TXT Sort Qualifier

Canonic numbers are pure numbers that do *not* have leading **zeroes**
before or trailing **zeroes** after a decimal point. Thus, **1.1** is a
canonic number but **01.1** and **1.10** are *not*. A *non*-canonic
string is everything else. For example, **"8C"** is a *non*-canonic
string.

This distinction is important when sorting, because in all VA FileMan
sorting, *canonic numbers sort first*, and everything else sorts second.
Usually, this works very well. But in a few cases where sort fields
contain a mix of canonic numbers and *non*-canonic strings, unexpected
sort orders result. Classic cases include sorting on Social Security
Numbers and on ward locations.

Consider Social Security Numbers (SSNs). The SSNs **666333333** and
**666999900** are canonic numbers. But the SSN **000769000** is *not* a
canonic number, because of its leading **zeroes**. When you use the
default sort based on SSN, you get output that looks like [Figure
12]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref523989248 .anchor}Figure : Print---Sorting Canonic and
Non-Canonic Numbers

PATIENT LIST JUL 19,1996 11:36 PAGE 1

SSN NAME

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

666333333 FMPATIENT,13

666999900 FMPATIENT,14

000769000 FMPATIENT,15

In this example ([Figure 12]{.underline}), you see that SSN
**000769000** is *non*-canonic due to its leading **zeroes**, so it
sorts *after* SSN **666999900**, which is canonic.

A similar situation occurs when you sort on ward locations. Suppose you
have wards **8**, **8C**, and **9**. Wards **8** and **9** are canonic
numbers, while ward **8C** is a *non*-canonic string. Thus, if you sort
on ward location, your output comes out in this order: **8**, **9**,
**8C**.

To avoid this problem, use the sort qualifier "**;TXT**" on your sort
field. This forces all field values to be *non*-canonic, with the result
that a group of strings like **8**, **8C**, and **9** sort in the
expected order.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information on the "**;TXT**" sort
qualifier, see the list of Sort Qualifiers in [Table 2]{.underline}.

#### Sorting to Select Entries for Printing

Besides using sorting to determine the *order* of entries printed, you
can also use the "START WITH \...:" prompt to restrict what entries are
printed to a range. For example, if you accept the default sort range
(from first to last), you can get a report with every item in the file
listed. You can cut this list down to a subset of the entries in the
file by how you sort (e.g.,Â entries that sort from **FMPATIENT**,A to
**FMPATIENT**,Z only).

To specify a sort range, enter the range starting point at the "START
WITH\...:" prompt, and the range end point at the "GO TO\...:" prompt.
For example:

[]{#_Toc527389217 .anchor}Figure : Print---Specifying a Sort Range

SORT BY: NAME// **\<Enter\>**

START WITH NAME: FIRST// **FMPATIENT,A**

GO TO NAME: LAST// **FMPATIENT,Z**

#### Selecting All Entries with the Same Value for One Field

A simple kind of selecting can be done to choose only those entries that
have a particular value for a field. For example, to list only those
patients who have a DIAGNOSIS equal to **CANCER**, you can sort as in
the example in [Figure 14]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref472422752 .anchor}Figure : Print---Choosing Entries with a
Specific Value

START WITH DIAGNOSIS: FIRST// **CANCER**

GO TO DIAGNOSIS: LAST// **CANCER**

#### Other Ways of Selecting Entries

The "START WITH \... GO TO \..." dialogue can be used to do
sophisticated selecting from a file. Computed expressions can be entered
at the prompts to filter the entries to be printed.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** These powerful techniques are discussed in
the "Computed Expressions" section in the *VA FileMan Advanced User
Manual*.

You can also use VA FileMan's search functions to select entries for
printing.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information on VA FileMan's search
functions, see the "[Search]{.underline}" section.

#### Including Entries with NULL Fields in Your Sort (Start with @)

When you sort a report on a particular field, if any record in the file
has *no value* in that field (i.e.,Â **NULL**) that record is *skipped*
and *not printed*, if you accept the default sort start value (FIRST).
In other words, in a print from the PATIENT (#2) file, if you sort on
the PROVIDER field, start sorting from the default of FIRST, and there
are some patients with nothing in their PROVIDER field (i.e.,Â **NULL**),
those patients are *left off of the report entirely*.

If you want to include records in your report, even if they have no
value in the field on which you are sorting (i.e.,Â **NULL**), sort from
**@** instead of accepting the default of FIRST. As in [Figure
15]{.underline}, enter an at-sign (**@**) at the "START WITH:" prompt:

[]{#_Ref345588331 .anchor}Figure : Print---Dialogue to Include Records
with NULL Values: Sample User Entries at Prompts

Select VA FileMan Option: **PRINT \<Enter\>** File Entries

OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: PATIENT// **\<Enter\>**

SORT BY: NAME// **PROVIDER**

START WITH PROVIDER: FIRST// **@**

GO TO PROVIDER: LAST// **\<Enter\>**

WITHIN PROVIDER, SORT BY: **\<Enter\>**

FIRST PRINT FIELD: **NAME**

1 NAME

THEN PRINT FIELD: **\<Enter\>**

Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// **\<Enter\>**

\...SORRY, THIS MAY TAKE A FEW MOMENTS\...

The output of this sort would then include all records, even those with
no value in their PROVIDER fields:

#### Sort Qualifier Reference

As well as entering fields to sort by, you can also enter formatting
controls in the "SORT BY:" dialogue. Add these qualifiers to the field
label or to the computed expression you are entering at the "SORT BY:"
prompt.

##### Sort Qualifiers to Use at "SORT BY:" Prompts

[Table 2]{.underline} lists the sort qualifiers you can use at the "SORT
BY:" prompts:

#### Saving Sort Criteria (SORT Templates)

You can save your sort criteria in a SORT template. This lets you reuse
the same sorting instructions in future prints from the current file.
SORT templates are stored in the SORT TEMPLATE (#.401) file. If you sort
by more than **three** fields, you are asked whether you want to store
your sort criteria in a SORT template, as shown in [Figure
17]{.underline}.

##### Forcing Creation of a SORT Template

Ordinarily, you are only asked whether to save your sort criteria in a
SORT template if you enter **three** or more fields at the "SORT BY:"
prompts. However, to force this question to be asked, enter a right
bracket ( **\]** ) by itself at one "SORT BY:" prompt. No matter how few
fields you sort by, you are still prompted to save your sort criteria in
a SORT template.

##### Reusing Sort Criteria in New Reports

The reason to save sort criteria in a SORT template is so that you can
*reuse* your sort criteria in a new report from the same file.

To reuse a SORT template as the sort criteria in a new report, at the
"SORT BY:" prompt in the new report, enter a left bracket ( **\[** )
plus the template name:

### Choosing Print Fields

#### Specifying Fields to Print

After you have specified the order in which the output should occur, you
are asked to list the fields you want displayed for each file entry. In
the simplest case, fields are identified by their label. If you enter a
single question mark (**?**) at the prompt, a list of all the fields in
the file is displayed. If you enter the name of a Multiple, you are
asked for the subfields you want printed. A subfield *must* be specified
even if the Multiple has only one subfield.

To print all fields in the file, enter **ALL** (uppercase) at the "FIRST
PRINT FIELD:" prompt. You are then prompted:

[]{#_Toc527389224 .anchor}Figure : Print---Confirmation Message to Print
All Fields

Do you mean ALL the fields in the file? NO//

Enter **YES** to indicate all fields; otherwise, the file is searched
for field labels beginning with the letters "**ALL**".

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** Fields from other files can also be printed
using extended pointers. This technique is described in the "Using
Computed Expressions in COMPUTED Fields" section in the "Computed
Expressions" section in the *VA FileMan Advanced User Manual*. You can
also enter other computed expressions, which are also described in that
section.

#### Print Qualifier Reference

VA FileMan's print capabilities provide many ways to format a report. If
you do *not* specify any formatting controls, a format is constructed
automatically. The width of each field's print area is computed using
information from the field's definition. The default width is the larger
of the following in the print dialogue:

-   Maximum number of characters allowed for the field.

-   Length of the longest word of the field's label (or other
    specification).

**Two** inter-column spaces are added to separate fields.

By using print qualifiers at the "PRINT FIELD:" prompt, for each field,
you can indicate:

-   How long the field's print area should be.

-   Where it should start.

-   How many lines to skip before printing the field.

-   Column title for the field.

-   Insert literal strings within the output.

For fields that have numeric values, you can call for several arithmetic
calculations and indicate the number of decimal digits of accuracy. If
you have requested subtotals in the sort dialogue (by preceding the
field with a **+**), calculations are done at the subtotal level as
well.

##### Print Qualifiers to use at "PRINT FIELD:" Prompts

[Table 3]{.underline} lists the print qualifiers you can use at the
"PRINT FIELD:" prompts:

| d**;B** | sorted order | printed in order by Internal Entry Number  |
|         |              | (IEN). The **;B** print specifier ensures  |
|         |              | that subentries are displayed in order by  |
|         |              | the value of the **.01** field.            |
+---------+--------------+--------------------------------------------+
| field** | Set start    | You can specify the starting column of a   |
| ;C*n*** | column       | field's display. If the number (***n***)   |
|         | position     | is a positive number, the field prints in  |
|         |              | that column counting from the left margin. |
|         |              | If it is negative, the field starts in     |
|         |              | that column as subtracted from the right   |
|         |              | margin. If there is *not* enough room on a |
|         |              | line for the field to display properly, it |
|         |              | is moved to the line below. Adding **;C1** |
|         |              | always starts a field's display at the     |
|         |              | beginning of a line.                       |
+---------+--------------+--------------------------------------------+
| field** | Round        | Specify the number of decimal digits of    |
| ;D*n*** | decimal      | accuracy with a number, "***n***". If      |
|         | fractions    | ***n*=0**, the number is rounded to a      |
|         |              | whole number. The number (***n***) *must   |
|         |              | be* **\> 0** *or* **= 0**.                 |
+---------+--------------+--------------------------------------------+
| field** | Left justify | To left justify within a field width of    |
| ;L*n*** | and truncate | "***n***" characters, follow the **;L**    |
|         |              | with the number of column positions you    |
|         |              | want the field to occupy. If necessary,    |
|         |              | the data is truncated to fit into this     |
|         |              | length. Since *non*-numeric fields are     |
|         |              | left justified by default, the only effect |
|         |              | of **;L** on those fields is truncation.   |
|         |              | This qualifier does *not* affect           |
|         |              | DATE/TIME-valued fields.                   |

+---------+--------------+--------------------------------------------+
| field** | Right        | To right justify within a field of         |
| ;R*n*** | justify text | "***n***" characters, follow the **;R**    |
|         |              | with that number. Right-justified data is  |
|         |              | *not* truncated; if "***n***" is *not*     |
|         |              | large enough; data spills into the next    |
|         |              | field's area causing confusing output.     |
|         |              | DATA TYPE field values of NUMERIC are      |
|         |              | right justified by default. However,       |
|         |              | COMPUTED expressions with numeric results  |
|         |              | are *not* right justified automatically.   |
+---------+--------------+--------------------------------------------+
| field** | Skip lines   | You can indicate a number of lines to skip |
| ;S*n*** | between      | before printing a field by using           |
|         | fields       | **;S*n***. Without a number, **;S** skips  |
|         |              | a single line. If your field has a         |
|         |              | **NULL** value, "***n***" lines are        |
|         |              | skipped anyway. You *cannot* use **;S**    |
|         |              | with a WORD-PROCESSING-type field. To skip |
|         |              | one line before a WORD-PROCESSING field,   |
|         |              | precede the field with an additional print |
|         |              | specification like this:                   |
|         |              |                                            |
|         |              | THEN PRINT FIELD: **"";S**                 |

| d**;T** | TITLE as     | defined in the data dictionary, instead of |
|         | header       | its LABEL in the header, add **;T**.       |
+---------+--------------+--------------------------------------------+
| field** | Wrap text    | The **;W** suffix splits a field that is   |
| ;W*n*** |              | too long for its field column width at     |
|         |              | word boundaries (spaces) and prints it out |
|         |              | fully on **two** or more rows. You can     |
|         |              | optionally follow the **;W** with the      |
|         |              | number of column positions to be occupied  |
|         |              | by each line of output. If the field's     |

|         |              | print in word-wrap mode, DATA TYPE field   |
|         |              | values of WORD-PROCESSING are              |
|         |              | automatically wrapped. The **;W** suffix   |
|         |              | overrides the **;R** or **;L** suffixes;   |
|         |              | *do not use them together*.                |

|         | inter-column | inserted before a field and the column     |
|         | spaces       | header for the field. The result is        |
|         |              | concatenation of the field with the field  |
|         |              | that came before it. The **;X** suffix is  |
|         |              | often used to add a literal caption to a   |
|         |              | field.                                     |

|         |              |                                            |
|         |              | THEN PRINT FIELD: **NAME;X**               |
|         |              |                                            |

+---------+--------------+--------------------------------------------+

: []{#_Ref446235223 .anchor}Table : Search---Condition Tests

You can string together several of these print qualifiers at the "PRINT
FIELD:" prompt. For example:

[]{#_Toc527389225 .anchor}Figure : Print---Stringing Several Print
Qualifiers Together

THEN PRINT FIELD: **+WEIGHT;S1;C3;L6;"Patient Weight"**

These specifications translate to: total, count, and give the mean for
all values of the WEIGHT field, which *must* be a NUMERIC valued field.
Skip one line before printing the values. Start the output in column
three, left justify and truncate it to **six** character positions, and
print the column heading "Patient Weight" on **two** lines.

#### Saving Print Criteria (PRINT Templates)

PRINT templates let you store your print field specifications for use at
a later time. You can retrieve the template at a later time by using the
template name surrounded by square brackets ( **\[ \]** ). Template
names *must* be unique with respect to any other PRINT template created
for the same file. VA FileMan notifies you if you try to create a
template with a template name that already exists for a file. PRINT
templates are stored in the PRINT TEMPLATE (#.4) file.

To see a list of all existing templates that pertain to the file you are
dealing with, enter a left bracket and a question mark (**\[?**) at the
prompt where you can retrieve templates. For example:

[]{#_Toc527389226 .anchor}Figure : Print---Obtaining a List of All Print
Templates for a File

FIRST PRINT FIELD: **\[?**

This gives you a list of the PRINT templates available for your use with
the file.

You are automatically prompted for a template name when it is determined
that a considerable amount of information has been specified. If you
choose **five** or more print fields, or if some of your print fields
have special formatting specifications, you are prompted to store your
print field specification in a PRINT template, as follows:

[]{#_Toc527389227 .anchor}Figure : Print---Creating a Print Template

STORE PRINT LOGIC IN TEMPLATE:

If you do *not* want to store your specifications in a template, simply
press the **Enter** key. If you do want to save these print
specifications for future reuse, however, respond to this prompt with
the name of a template (either new or existing). Do *not* enclose the
name in brackets; use brackets only to invoke a template, *not* to name
one.

##### Forcing Creation of a PRINT Template

Ordinarily, you are only asked whether you want to save your PRINT
template if you enter **five** or more fields at the "PRINT FIELD:"
prompt, or enter complex print specifications. However, by entering a
right bracket ( **\]** ) by itself at one of your field prompts, you can
force the prompt that asks you for a template name, no matter how few
fields you specify. You *must* designate at least one field to be
printed to receive the template prompt, though.

For example:

[]{#_Toc527389228 .anchor}Figure : Print---Forcing the Creation of a
Print Template

PRINT FIELD: **\] \<Enter\>**

PRINT FIELD: **NAME**

THEN PRINT FIELD: **\<Enter\>**

HEADING: **\<Enter\>**

STORE PRINT LOGIC IN TEMPLATE: **ID PRINT**

##### Using and Editing PRINT Templates

If a PRINT template has already been defined for a file, you can answer
the "FIRST PRINT FIELD:" prompt with the template name, enclosed within
square brackets ( **\[ \]** ). For example:

[]{#_Ref490837427 .anchor}Figure : Print---Reusing a Print Template

FIRST PRINT FIELD: **\[PATIENT DATA\]**

WANT TO EDIT 'PATIENT DATA' TEMPLATE? NO// **Y \<Enter\>** (YES)

NAME: PATIENT DATA// **\<Enter\>**

READ ACCESS: **\<Enter\>**

WRITE ACCESS: **\<Enter\>**

After you retrieve a template, you are asked if you want to edit the
template. If you answer **YES** (as shown in [Figure 25]{.underline}),
you are allowed to edit the template name. To delete the template, enter
an at-sign (**@**). After the "NAME:" prompt, you can edit the template
security codes for **READ** and **WRITE** access.

Next, you are prompted to edit each "PRINT FIELD:" value, containing
each print field stored in the template. You can leave each print field
as is, edit it, or delete it with the at-sign character (**@**).

To insert a new print field ahead of the print field being displayed in
your template, precede the print field you want to insert with a caret
(**\^**). See the example in [Figure 26]{.underline} of adding to a
PRINT template (INPUT and SORT templates have this feature also):

[]{#_Ref389661454 .anchor}Figure : Print---Inserting a New Print Field

FIRST PRINT FIELD: FIELD1// **\<Enter\>**

THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD2// **\<Enter\>**

THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD4// **\^FIELD3**

THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD4// **\<Enter\>**

To insert a Multiple field and its subfields ahead of the field
currently displayed in the template, do the following:

1.  Enter a caret (**\^**) followed by the name of the Multiple field.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
14. Ignore the default presented at the "THEN PRINT FIELD:" prompt and
    insert each subfield by entering a caret (**\^**) followed by the
    name of that subfield.

15. After all subfields have been added, enter a caret (**\^**) and a
    right bracket (**\^\]**).

For example:

[]{#_Toc527389231 .anchor}Figure : Print---Inserting a Multiple Print
Field

FIRST PRINT FIELD: FIELD1// **\<Enter\>**

THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD2// **\<Enter\>**

THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD3// **\^MultField \<Enter\>** (multiple)

THEN PRINT MultField SUB-FIELD: FIELD3// **\^SubField1**

THEN PRINT MultField SUB-FIELD: FIELD3// **\^SubField2**

THEN PRINT MultField SUB-FIELD: FIELD3// **\^\]**

THEN PRINT FIELD: FIELD3//

#### CAPTIONED PRINT Template: \[CAPTIONED

Every file has a pre-defined CAPTIONED PRINT template that you can
select at the "PRINT FIELD:" prompt. The CAPTIONED PRINT template can be
very useful; it prints out all fields for each entry in your report. Use
it is a quick way to get all the fields for each entry in your report
(much quicker than entering each field individually)!

Use it as follows:

[]{#_Toc527389232 .anchor}Figure : Print---Choosing a Captioned Print
Template

FIRST PRINT FIELD: **\[CAPTIONED**

##### COMPUTED Fields and Record Numbers in CAPTIONED OUTPUT

When you choose the CAPTIONED PRINT template, you are prompted with
"Include COMPUTED fields". At this prompt, you can decide whether to
include COMPUTED-type fields in the output for each record, as well as
record numbers.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information on COMPUTED fields, see
the "COMPUTED Data Type" section in the *VA FileMan Advanced User
Manual*.

[]{#_Toc527389233 .anchor}Figure : Print---Dialogue Encountered when
Creating a Captioned Print Report

FIRST PRINT FIELD: **\[CAPTIONED**

Include COMPUTED fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO// **?**

Enter a code from the list.

Select one of the following:

N NO - No record number (IEN), no Computed Fields

Y Computed Fields

R Record Number (IEN)

B BOTH Computed Fields and Record Number (IEN)

Include COMPUTED fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO// **BOTH \<Enter\>** Computed
Fields and Record Number (IEN)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Heading (S/C): NEW PERSON LIST// **\<Enter\>**

DEVICE: **\<Enter\>**

#### Printing Statistics Only (Totals, Counts, etc.)

If you precede *all* of the fields that you choose for printing at the
"PRINT FIELD:" prompts with a **+**, **&**, **!**, or **\#**, the
individual field values are *not* printed in your report. Instead, you
only get the requested statistics, which (depending on the print
qualifiers and fields used) can be the total, count, mean, maximum,
minimum, and/or standard deviation.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information about print qualifiers,
see the "[Print Qualifier Reference](#print-qualifier-reference)"
section.

### Other Print Features

-   [Multiple Copies of a Print](#multiple-copies-of-a-print)

-   [Report Headings](#report-headings)

-   [Suppressing Report Headings (and Page
    Feeds)](#suppressing-report-headings-and-page-feeds)

-   [Custom Headings and Footers](#custom-headings-and-footers)

-   [Printing Sort Criteria in Header or
    Footer](#printing-sort-criteria-in-the-heading-or-the-footer)

#### Multiple Copies of a Print

To generate more than one copy of a report, you *must* have an output
device on your system (e.g.,Â a spool device or a sequential disk
processor \[SDP\]), which stores data in a linear format. If you choose
to send the output to such a device at the "DEVICE:" prompt, the system
prompts you as shown in [Figure 30]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref490837707 .anchor}Figure : Print---Generating Multiple Copies of
a Report

ENTER NUMBER OF COPIES: **4**

OUTPUT COPIES TO DEVICE: **PRINTER**

In this example ([Figure 30]{.underline}), you are asking to print
**four** copies to the device called **PRINTER**.

You *must* be using VA FileMan with Kernel or with a device handler
similar to Kernel's to produce multiple copies. If you exceed the
maximum spool lines allowed, as defined in the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS
(#8989.3) file, your report is stopped.

#### Report Headings

The heading in a report is what is printed at the top of each report
page. Ordinarily, it includes the following, as shown in [Figure
31]{.underline}:

-   Heading (report title)

-   Date of report

-   Time of report

-   Page number

-   Column headers (field titles for fields in the output)

[]{#_Ref490837828 .anchor}Figure : Print---Example of a Report Heading

PATIENT LIST JUL 19,1996 14:49 PAGE 1

SSN NAME

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

You can customize the report heading when you print. If you ask for help
at the "Heading (S/C):\..." prompt, VA FileMan displays the instructions
shown in [Figure 32]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref345588354 .anchor}Figure : Print---Dialogue to Customize Report
Headings: Sample User Entries at Prompts

Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// **?**

There are two different options:

1\) Accept the default heading or enter a custom heading.

For no heading at all, type @.

To use a Print Template for the heading, type \[TEMPLATE NAME\].

2\) Replace the default heading with:

S to Suppress the heading when there are no records to print, and/or

C to print sort Criteria in the heading.

If S and/or C is entered, the heading prompt will re-appear.

Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// **CS**

\*\* Suppress the heading when there are no records to print.

\*\* print sort Criteria in heading.

Heading: PATIENT LIST//

Thus, at the "Heading (S/C):" prompt, you can:

-   Enter **S** to *not* print the heading (i.e.,Â *not* print anything),
    if no records are found to print.

-   Enter **C** to print sort criteria in the report heading on the
    first page.

-   Enter a new heading to replace the default heading or press the
    **Enter** key to accept the default heading.

#### Suppressing Report Headings (and Page Feeds)

If you do *not* want headings to be printed in your output, enter an
at-sign (**@**) at the "HEADING:" prompt:

[]{#_Toc527389237 .anchor}Figure : Print---Suppressing Headings on a
Report

HEADING: PATIENT LIST// **@**

If you want neither headings nor page feeds in your output, enter
**two** at-signs (**@@**) at the "HEADING:" prompt.

If you suppress the headings in your output and also save your print
criteria in a PRINT template, you are asked:

[]{#_Toc527389238 .anchor}Figure : Print---Confirming the Suppression of
Headings in a Print Template

DO YOU ALWAYS WANT TO SUPPRESS SUBHEADERS WHEN PRINTING TEMPLATE?

Subheaders are the names of SORT BY fields you see in the body of your
report, when you do *not* include those SORT BY fields as print fields.
To automatically suppress all subheaders, answer **YES** at this prompt.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** When you are sorting, you can suppress
subheaders individually at each sort level by entering an at-sign
(**@**) in front of the field on which you are sorting.\
\
**REF:** For more information, see the "[Sorting](#sorting)" section.

#### Custom Headings and Footers

You can print complex, multi-line headings by using a PRINT template to
hold your heading format. For example, suppose that you want the
patient's name and date of birth to appear as the heading at every page
break. You could first create a PATIENT HEADER template as follows:

[]{#_Toc527389239 .anchor}Figure : Print---Creating a Print Template
with a Custom Header

SORT BY: **NAME**

START WITH NAME: FIRST// **\<Enter\>**

FIRST PRINT FIELD: **"PATIENT NAME: "**

THEN PRINT FIELD: **NAME**

THEN PRINT FIELD: **"DATE OF BIRTH: ";C50**

THEN PRINT FIELD: **DATE OF BIRTH**

THEN PRINT FIELD: **\<Enter\>**

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// **\<Enter\>**

STORE PRINT LOGIC IN TEMPLATE: **PATIENT HEADER**

Are you adding 'PATIENT HEADER' as a new PRINT TEMPLATE? No// **YES
\<Enter\>** (Yes)

DEVICE:

Then, at a later time, when you do another print, at the heading prompt,
enter the template name:

[]{#_Toc527389240 .anchor}Figure : Print---Selecting an Existing Print
Template with a Custom Header

Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// **\[PATIENT HEADER\]**

When you enter a PRINT template name such as PATIENT HEADER at the
"Heading (S/C):\..." prompt, the format of the template is used as a
replacement for the full normal report heading on each page of your
report. It replaces the full default heading, including:

-   Title

-   Time

-   Date

-   Page number

-   Field names

-   Separator line

Thus, the header, as defined above, would contain *no* column headings
and would *not* be separated from the body of the report by a horizontal
line or even a blank line. You can add these in yourself as print fields
in the template, if you so desire.

##### Custom Footers

You can also add custom footers to the bottom of each page of a report.
First, save the contents of the footer in a template as you do to create
a custom heading. Then, use the template at the "HEADING:" prompt with a
dash (-) before the first square bracket, as shown in [Figure
37]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref523996613 .anchor}Figure : Print---Including a Custom Footer in
a Print Template

Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// **-\[PATIENT FOOTER\]**

You can specify both a heading and footer like this:

[]{#_Toc527389242 .anchor}Figure : Print---Including a Custom Header and
Footer in a Print Template

Heading (S/C): PATIENT LIST// **\[PATIENT HEADER\]-\[PATIENT FOOTER\]**

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** Specifying only a footer at the "Heading
(S/C):" prompt suppresses the default heading. If you need a header as
well as footer, you *must* use custom templates for both.

#### Printing Sort Criteria in the Heading or the Footer

You can print the sort criteria (values used to sort the report) in the
header in two different ways:

-   At the "Heading (S/C):" prompt, entering **C** prints the sort
    criteria in the automatically generated report heading.

-   Use the [sort qualifier](#sort-qualifier-reference) **;P*a*-*b*** to
    save the FROM and TO values used to sort a report. Then, in a
    customized header or footer (stored in SORT templates), you can
    retrieve the sort values with **PARAM("*a-string*")**.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information, see the description of
the [**;****P****a-b**](#pa-b) sort qualifier.

# Search

When you print reports, you can print a subset of the total number of
file entries, if you sort your output. For example, by sorting on a
file's DATE field, you could sort for entries from October 1^st^ to
October 15^th^, and only print entries whose DATE field falls in that
sort range.

Selecting a subset of entries by sorting works well if the subset of
entries you would like to print can be isolated based on a contiguous
sort range. However, what if you would like a different set of entries
(e.g.,Â only entries whose DATE field is equal to September 1^st^,
October 1^st^, or November 1^st^)? You *cannot* do this with a sort
range, because the sort range that includes September 1^st^ and November
1^st^ would include every entry between the two dates.

When you use VA FileMan's search capabilities, you have much more
control over what entries you select from a file for printing.

## How to Search

As with VA FileMan's print capabilities, there are two methods in which
you can use VA FileMan's search features:

-   An option that has been set up already to allow you to search a
    particular file.

-   VA FileMan's **Search File Entries** \[DISEARCH\] option, which lets
    you perform a search on any file to which you have access.

In either case, use of VA FileMan's search features is very similar. In
most cases, the only difference is that with the **Search File Entries**
\[DISEARCH\] option, you have to choose which file to search.

The steps in searching are:

1.  Enter the search conditions (truth tests) to perform on each entry.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
16. Specify how the search conditions should be combined (link them
    together with logical **AND**s & **OR**s) to select records.

17. Format your output (i.e.,Â choose the sort order and print fields).

## Search Steps

### Enter Conditions

First, you *must* enter **one** or more search conditions to test each
entry. For each condition you choose a field in the entry and a
condition to compare the field against.

For example, you could check if an entry's DATE field is **NULL**,
**GREATER THAN** 10/1/96, or **EQUALS** 10/1/96.

#### Search Condition Tests

[Table 4]{.underline} lists the **six** possible search conditions
against which you can test entries. It also includes:

-   The symbol that represents the condition (if any).

-   For what field types the condition can be used.

-   The description/arguments of each condition.

+------------+---------+---------------+------------------------------+
| Condition  | Symbol  | For Field     | Description/Arguments        |

: []{#_Ref345508725 .anchor}Table : Search---Condition Operators

When you start your search, VA FileMan asks you to enter a:

1.  Field.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
18. Condition.

19. Value to which the field is compared.

For example, to create a search condition that would find all entries
whose DATE ACCESS CODE LAST CHANGED field contains a date older than
**120** days in the past, you would enter the following:

[]{#_Toc527389243 .anchor}Figure : Search---Example of a Search
Condition

-A- SEARCH FOR FIELD: **DATE ACCESS CODE LAST CHANGED**

-A- CONDITION: **LESS THAN**

-A- GREATER THAN: **T-120 \<Enter\>** (Jun 20, 1995)

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** Each prompt above begins with "**-A-**";
what you have entered becomes search condition **A**.

Once you enter your first search condition, you can enter additional
search conditions, if you wish. VA FileMan assigns the letter **A** to
the first search condition, **B** to the second search condition (if
any), **C** to the third, and so on.

[Figure 40]{.underline} is an example of entering two truth tests:

[]{#_Ref524016018 .anchor}Figure : Search---Example of Two Truth Tests

-A- SEARCH FOR FIELD: **DATE ACCESS CODE LAST CHANGED**

-A- CONDITION: **LESS THAN**

-A- GREATER THAN: **T-120 \<Enter\>** (Jun 20, 1995)

-B- SEARCH FOR FIELD: **ACCESS CODE**

-B- CONDITION: **'NULL**

-C- SEARCH FOR FIELD: **\<Enter\>**

### Combine Conditions

After defining a series of conditions (**A**, **B**, etc.), you combine
the conditions to yield the complete test that an entry *must* satisfy
to be selected in the search. The complete test is a logical combination
of tests **A**, **B**, etc., using **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT**.

#### Operators for Combining Search Conditions

[Table 5]{.underline} lists the possible operators to combine search
conditions:

+------------+---------+-------------------------------+--------------+
| Condition  | Symbol  | Description                   | Example      |
+============+=========+===============================+==============+
| **AND**    | **&**   | For truth test to be          | **A&B**      |
|            |         | **true**, the conditions on   |              |
|            |         | both sides of the **AND**     |              |
|            |         | operator *must* be **true**.  |              |
|            |         | The **&** symbol can be       |              |
|            |         | omitted (i.e.,Â **AB** is the  |              |
|            |         | same as **A&B**).             |              |
+------------+---------+-------------------------------+--------------+
| **NOT**    | **'**   | For truth test to be          | **'A**       |
|            | or      | **true**, the condition       |              |
|            | **-**   | following **NOT**             |              |
|            |         | (i.e.,Â single quote **'** or  |              |
|            |         | dash **-**) *must* be         |              |
|            |         | **false**. If **A** is        |              |
|            |         | **false**, **'A** evaluates   |              |
|            |         | to **true**.                  |              |
+------------+---------+-------------------------------+--------------+
| **OR**     | Enter   | For truth test to be          | IF: **A      |
|            | on new  | **true**, only one of the     | \<Enter\>**  |
|            | line.   | conditions that are combined  |              |
|            |         | with **OR** needs to be       | OR: **B      |
|            |         | **true**. If **A** is         | \<Enter\>**  |
|            |         | **true** and **B** is         |              |
|            |         | **false**, **A OR B**         |              |
|            |         | evaluates to **true**.        |              |
+------------+---------+-------------------------------+--------------+

: []{#_Ref345509562 .anchor}Table : Browser---Navigation Keystrokes

For example, if you just want to find all entries for which search
condition **A** is **true**, you would enter:

[]{#_Toc527389245 .anchor}Figure : Search---Example of a Single Search
Condition Using a Truth Test

-B- SEARCH FOR FIELD: **\<Enter\>**

IF: **A**

OR: **\<Enter\>**

A more complicated search might have a number of search conditions
(e.g.,Â **A**, **B**, **C**, and **D**). Thus, for example, to find all
entries which do either of the following:

-   Satisfy both truth tests **A** and **B**.

-   Do *not* satisfy truth test **C**, but satisfy truth test **D**.

You could combine search conditions, as shown in [Figure
42]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref524016944 .anchor}Figure : Search---Example of a Multiple Search
Condition Using Truth Tests

-E- SEARCH FOR FIELD: **\<Enter\>**

IF: **A&B**

OR: **'C&D**

OR: **\<Enter\>**

In the example above, the logic says "if **A** and **B**, or if *not*
**C** (but **D**)".

### Format Output

The remaining steps to finish your search are to choose your sorting
criteria (same as with printing) and to choose the fields to print for
each matched entry (also the same as with the printing).

A complete search (entering search conditions, combining search
conditions, and finishing the search) is shown in [Figure
43]{.underline}:

greater than **2/2/99** and ACCESS CODE *not* **NULL**).

## Details and Features

### Sorting and Searching

As you recall from the "[Print]{.underline}" section, you can print a
subset of entries from a file by sorting (i.e.,Â printing only those
entries that fall between a sort-from value and a sort-to value).
Searches also select a subset of entries from a file, although with more
flexibility than with sorting.

When you print your output from a search, you are also given a chance to
sort the output. This means that while searching selects a subset of
entries to print, through sorting you can further restrict that subset
of entries that is going to print. How does sorting affect the output of
the searches?

The answer is that VA FileMan uses *both* your search and sort order to
select entries. You enter the search criteria *before* you enter the
sort order. However, the selection of entries indicated in the sort
("START WITH ... GO TO" dialogue) sorting is done first, after which the
search conditions are applied to all remaining entries to determine the
final set of matching entries.

### SEARCH Templates

You can save the results of your search in a SEARCH template. Doing this
allows you to:

-   Reuse your search criteria to perform another search.

-   Reuse your search results (the list of entries selected as a result
    of both the search and the sort order).

This is because SEARCH templates store both your search criteria and
also the list of entries that is found in your search. SEARCH templates
are stored in the SORT TEMPLATE (#.401) file.

#### Creating SEARCH Templates

The place to save your search criteria and results in a SEARCH template
is right after you specify your search conditions. At this point, you
are prompted:

[]{#_Toc527389248 .anchor}Figure : Search---Creating a Search Template

STORE RESULTS OF SEARCH IN TEMPLATE:

You can create a template at this prompt. Because SEARCH templates are
stored in the same file as SORT templates (SORT TEMPLATE \[#.401\]), you
*cannot* give a SEARCH template the same name as a SORT template. To
avoid creating a SEARCH template, just press the **Enter** key at this
prompt. Usually, only the creator of a SEARCH template can use it.

#### Reusing Search Criteria Stored in a SEARCH Template

Whenever you do a search, you can reuse the search criteria (i.e.,Â your
combined search conditions) stored in a SEARCH template. To do this,
enter the bracketed SEARCH template name at the first "SEARCH FOR
FIELD:" prompt:

[]{#_Toc527389249 .anchor}Figure : Search---Reusing a Search Template at
the "SEARCH FOR FIELD" Prompt

-A- SEARCH FOR FIELD: **\[RESEARCH 1\]**

A new search is performed with the recalled search criteria.

#### Reusing Search Results in another Search

Whenever you do a search, you can recall the results of a previous
search (the list of entries found in the search) at the "SORT BY:"
prompt. In this case, the new search is done against the entries in the
SEARCH template, rather than the entire file. Answer the "SORT BY:"
prompt with the bracketed SEARCH template name:

[]{#_Toc527389250 .anchor}Figure : Search---Reusing a Search Template at
the "SORT BY" Prompt

SORT BY: NAME// **\[RESEARCH 1\]**

#### Reusing Search Results in a Print

When doing VA FileMan prints, you can also recall the results of a
previous search at the "SORT BY:" prompt. In this case, the entries
saved in the SEARCH template are the ones printed in the report. This is
handy if you do a search, collect a group of entries, and then want to
print several different reports based on the same set of entries.

### Internal vs. External Field Values for Search Conditions

The following are search conditions for specific DATA TYPE fields:

-   **SET OF CODES---**You *must* use external values for the search
    conditions.

-   **DATE/TIME** and **COMPUTED** (that evaluate to
    **DATE/TIME**)**---**You can enter internal or external values for
    the search conditions.

-   **NUMERIC**, **COMPUTED** (that do *not* evaluate to **DATE/TIME**),
    and **FREE TEXT---**There is no difference between internal and
    external value.

-   **POINTER TO A FILE** or **VARIABLE-POINTER---**The sort is based on
    the field type of the **.01** field of the pointed-to file.

### Print Number of Matches Found

If you only want to print the number of matches found, *without*
printing any of the matched entries, answer the "FIRST PRINT FIELD:"
prompt by simply pressing the **Enter** key.

### Searching Multiples

Searching on Multiple-valued fields, like the DIAGNOSIS field in the
PATIENT (#2) file, is a special situation. You *must* specify whether a
truth test is to be considered met if *at least one* of the subentries
for an entry passes the test or if *all* the subentries *must* pass the
test.

When truth tests contain a negative (contains a single quote), you can
even specify that an entry with *no* subentries should automatically
pass the test.

For example, suppose that you want to search for all patients who were
born before **1920** and who *do not* have a DIAGNOSIS containing the
word ANGINA, as shown in [Figure 47]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref446319571 .anchor}Figure : Search---Dialogue of a Search on a
Multiple Field: Sample User Entries at Prompts

Select VA FileMan Option: **SEARCH \<Enter\>** File Entries

OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: PATIENT// **\<Enter\>**

-A- SEARCH FOR PATIENT FIELD: **DATE OF BIRTH**

-A- CONDITION: **\< \<Enter\>** LESS THAN

-A- LESS THAN DATE: **1920 \<Enter\>** (1920)

-B- SEARCH FOR PATIENT FIELD: **SERVICE CONNECTED**

1 SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS (multiple)

2 SERVICE CONNECTED PERCENTAGE

3 SERVICE CONNECTED?

CHOOSE 1-3: **1 \<Enter\>** SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS (multiple)

-B- SEARCH FOR PATIENT SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS SUB-FIELD: **SERVICE

-B- CONDITION: **\[ \<Enter\>** CONTAINS

-B- CONTAINS: **ANGINA**

-C- SEARCH FOR PATIENT SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS SUB-FIELD:
**\<Enter\>**

-C- SEARCH FOR PATIENT FIELD: **\<Enter\>**

IF: **A&'B \<Enter\>** DATE OF BIRTH LESS THAN 1920 (1920)

and not PATIENT SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS CONTAINS (case-insensitive)
"ANGINA"

DO YOU WANT THIS SEARCH SPECIFICATION TO BE CONSIDERED TRUE FOR
CONDITION -B-

1\) WHEN AT LEAST ONE OF THE 'SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS' MULTIPLES
SATISFIES IT

2\) WHEN ALL OF THE 'SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS' MULTIPLES SATISFY IT

3\) WHEN ALL OF THE 'SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS' MULTIPLES SATISFY IT,

OR WHEN THERE ARE NO 'SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONS' MULTIPLES

CHOOSE 1-3: 1// **3**

OR:

STORE RESULTS OF SEARCH IN TEMPLATE:

For this example, choosing the following number means:

-   **1** = Find people born before **1920** who have *at least one*
    SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITION that does *not* contain "ANGINA."

-   **2** = Find people born before **1920** who have *at least one*
    SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITION and *none* containing "ANGINA."

-   **3** = Find people born before **1920** who either have no SERVICE
    CONNECTED CONDITION at all or whose SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITIONs do
    *not* contain "ANGINA."

Another ambiguity about searches of multiple fields is how to interpret
two separate truth tests on the same subfield.

For example, if you are searching for DIAGNOSIS containing **ANGINA**
and also for DIAGNOSIS containing **PECTORIS**, do you want to find:

-   Only those patients who have **ANGINA** *and* **PECTORIS** in the
    *same* diagnosis name?

-   Patients who might have one diagnosis containing **ANGINA** and a
    *different* diagnosis containing **PECTORIS**?

Whenever you combine two truth tests (e.g.,Â **A** and **B**) pertaining
to the same Multiple-valued field, you are prompted with the following:

[]{#_Ref446319586 .anchor}Figure : Search---Prompts Encountered when
Searching on a Multiple Field

CONDITION -A- WILL APPLY TO THE SAME MULTIPLE AS CONDITION -B-

OK? YES//

In this example ([Figure 47]{.underline} and [Figure 48]{.underline}), a
**YES** answer means that **ANGINA** and **PECTORIS** *must* be found in
the *same* DIAGNOSIS. If you answer **NO**, you can specify how **A**
and **B** apply:[]{#_Hlt446381562 .anchor}

Figure : Search---Additional Prompts Encountered when Searching on a
Multiple Field

DO YOU WANT THIS SEARCH SPECIFICATION TO BE CONSIDERED TRUE FOR
CONDITION -A-

1\) WHEN AT LEAST ONE OF THE 'DIAGNOSIS' MULTIPLES SATISFIES IT

2\) WHEN ALL OF THE 'DIAGNOSIS' MULTIPLES SATISFY IT

CHOOSE 1-2: 1// **2**

DO YOU WANT THIS SEARCH SPECIFICATION TO BE CONSIDERED TRUE FOR
CONDITION -B-

1\) WHEN AT LEAST ONE OF THE 'DIAGNOSIS' MULTIPLES SATISFIES IT

2\) WHEN ALL OF THE 'DIAGNOSIS' MULTIPLES SATISFY IT

CHOOSE 1-2: 1// **\<Enter\>**

In this case, all the diagnoses would need to satisfy the **A**
condition, but only **one** (or more) would need to satisfy the **B**
condition.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** Applying search tests to fields in a
Multiple selects entries at the top-level of the file. VA FileMan's
searching features *cannot* be used to select specific subentries.

# Browser

If your site is using Kernel, your site manager may have set up an
output device called **BROWSER**. If so, you can view any report *on the
screen* instead of *on paper*. Do this by printing your report to the
**BROWSER** device instead of the **HOME** device or a printer.

The Browser makes it very easy to view reports on screen. Its main
features are:

-   Scroll forwards *and backwards* through a report. This means you do
    *not* lose reports "off the top" of the screen, like you do when you
    print to the **HOME** device.

-   Use the Search feature to find and immediately jump to any text in a
    report.

-   Copy text from the report to the VA FileMan clipboard; later, if you
    are editing a mail message or other WORD-PROCESSING-type field with
    the Screen Editor, you can paste from the clipboard.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information on the Screen Editor,
see the "[Screen Editor]{.underline}" section.

As you become accustomed to using the **BROWSER** device, you may find
that you start to save paper by viewing reports that otherwise you would
end up printing.

The [**Browser** \[DDBROWSER\]](#browser-as-an-option) option lets you
browse the contents of any WORD-PROCESSING-type field to which you have
access.

### Browser as an Option

As well as being able send output to the **BROWSER** device, you can use
the VA FileMan **Browser** \[DDBROWSER\] option, located under the
**Other Options** \[DIOTHER\] menu on the **VA FileMan** \[DIUSER\] main
menu, to view the contents of any WORD-PROCESSING-type field that you
have access to in the database. When you use the **Browser**
\[DDBROWSER\] option, you are prompted for the following:

-   File

-   WORD-PROCESSING field

-   Entry to view

By answering these prompts, you can view the contents of any accessible
WORD-PROCESSING field in the Browser.

# VA FileMan Prompts

Many VA VistA application packages have a *Scrolling Mode* interface.
Scrolling Mode works as follows:

1.  Computer puts a prompt on the screen.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
20. User enters a response to the prompt.

21. Computer places another prompt on the screen, scrolling down one
    line. Previous prompts move up and eventually off of the screen.

In Scrolling Mode, prompting occurs in the same predetermined order, in
a sequence designed by the application developer. You enter a value and
the computer stores your responses one at a time. And, unless you are
familiar with a few timesaving scrolling mode techniques, you have to
step through each prompt in a record before you can finish editing the
record.

Recently developed VistA applications often use a *screen-oriented*
interface (i.e.,Â Screen Mode) for editing data. However, scrolling mode
interfaces are still used quite heavily in VistA applications.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information on Screen Mode, see the
"[ScreenMan]{.underline}" section.

After reading about a few of the Scrolling Mode operations discussed in
this section, you should be able to enter and edit data in Scrolling
Mode with a minimum number of keystrokes.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** VA FileMan is in the process of converting
all *non*-developer dialogues to use VA FileMan (FM) dialogues
framework, so that translations can be table-driven.

## The \<Enter\> Key

To enter data in scrolling mode, you primarily enter data or commands at
a prompt on your terminal screen. After typing a command or data at your
terminal keyboard, you *must* send your response from your terminal to
the computer. Pressing the **Enter** key on your keyboard (abbreviated
as **\<Enter\>** in examples) sends all of your typed input to the
computer for action or storage.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** Some older documentation examples still
refer to it as the **Return** key (shown as **\<RET\>** in examples).

If you type a response but fail to press the **Enter** key, the computer
waits; it does *not* do anything until you indicate that you have
finished entering your response. Pressing the **Enter** key also
indicates to the computer when you have decided to "enter" nothing at
all. Whenever you press the **Enter** key without first entering data or
a command, you indicate to the computer either to avoid taking action or
to take the default action at the current prompt. The computer then
moves on to the next prompt.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** Some prompts require a user response; so,
if you only press the **Enter** key *without* a valid response, the
system continues to repeat the prompt until you respond with a valid
value.

## Standard Prompt Structure

The standard VA FileMan prompt consists of three parts:

[]{#_Toc527389255 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---Sample Component
Parts of a Prompt

![VA FileMan Prompts---Sample component parts of a prompt: 1) System
Prompt; 2) Default Response; and 3) User Response Sample: NAME:
FMUSER,ONE// FMUSER,TWO 1) \"NAME:\" This is the prompt question. It
could be the name of a record you mihgt edit. 2) \"FMUSER,ONE//\": This
part of the prompt is optional and does not always appear, since it is
VA FileMan\'s default value. Simply press the Enter key \<Enter\> here,
if this is the value you want. 3) \"FMUSER,TWO\": This is a response
entered by the user, and it now becomes the default value for this
record.](output/images/media/image8.jpeg "VA FileMan PromptsâSample Component Parts of a Prompt"){width="5.65625in"
height="3.03125in"}

## Responding to Prompts

When VA FileMan prompts you for a response, typically, a colon (**:**)
is used at the end of the prompt; the computer waits for a response.
Prompts are often asking for the value of a field in a file, like the
one shown in [Figure 52]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref523837130 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---Asking for a
Response

DATE OF BIRTH:

This type of prompt is waiting for you to enter a value (e.g.,Â **3 OCT
49**). Do *not* forget to press the **Enter** key
([**\<Enter\>**](#the-enter-key)) to complete your interaction.

If the answer to the prompt question is a choice of several things, the
prompt often starts with the word "**Select**", as in [Figure
53]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref523837145 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---"Select-type"
Prompts, Offering a Choice

Select PATIENT NAME:

If the question requires either a **YES** or **NO** response (in which
case simply entering **Y** or **N**, upper- or lowercase, is
acceptable), the prompt can end with a question mark, rather than by a
colon, as shown in [Figure 54]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref523837169 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---"Yes/No-type"
Prompts

ARE YOU SURE?

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information on the specific types
of fields (DATE/TIME, NUMERIC, WORD-PROCESSING, FREE TEXT, etc.) and how
to edit them, see the "[Field Types]{.underline}" section.

## Getting Online Help at Any Prompt (Enter ? or ??)

If you are *not* sure how to answer a prompt, help is always available.
Just enter one question mark (**?**) to get brief help, or two question
marks (**??**) to get more detailed online help:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Help Value     Description
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  **?**          Entering **one** question mark at a prompt gets a single
                 line of help.

  **??**         Entering **two** question marks at a prompt gets more
                 detailed help: a description of what values are
                 acceptable, and/or a list of choices appropriate to the
                 prompt where you entered the question marks.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  : []{#_Ref345582973 .anchor}Table : VA FileMan Prompts---"Replace"
  Prompt Shortcuts

## Incorrect Responses

VA FileMan checks each answer to a prompt immediately after you enter
it. If you answer a prompt incorrectly, VA FileMan "beeps," and displays
**two** spaces and **two** question marks. You may be given an
explanation of what was incorrect. Then, you are given a chance to
respond to the prompt again.

## Partial Responses

When you are choosing one of a set of responses, you can save keystrokes
by *not* typing the full response. Type in only the first letter of
first few letters representing the response that you desire. If the
characters you enter uniquely identify one of the possible acceptable
responses, VA FileMan "echoes back" the remaining characters and uses
the matching choice as your response.

If more than one possible answer begins with the characters that you
typed, VA FileMan displays the possible choices in a list, and asks you
to choose which choice you want by number:

[]{#_Ref345588389 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---Dialogue to
Choose from a List in VA FileMan: Sample User Entries at Prompts

OPTION: **S**

1 ScreenMan

2 Statistics

CHOOSE 1-3: **1 \<Enter\>** ScreenMan

## Default Responses

When working in VistA applications, the computer frequently presents a
*default* answer along with a prompt. This answer is built into the
application program and represents the most probable response to the
prompt that is being asked. These default answers are clearly identified
by the double slash marks that follow them (**//**). If the default
answer that is provided is correct, you need only press the **Enter**
key to accept it.

For example:

[]{#_Toc527389260 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---Prompts with
Default Responses

SSN: 000123124//

In this case, if you press the **Enter** key, **000123124** is posted as
your response to this prompt.

If, on the other hand, the default answer is *not* what you need, enter
the correct information at the prompt. For example:

[]{#_Toc527389261 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---Overriding the
Default Response to a Prompt

SSN: 000123124// **000234563 \<Enter\>**

When editing data stored in fields, defaults are used to present the
current value of the field. As with any default prompt, if you just
press the **Enter** key, the current value of the field is left
unchanged. To change the value of the field, enter a new value and press
the **Enter** key.

## Longer Default Responses and the "Replace...With" Editor

When a default is **20** or more characters in length, it is *not*
followed by double slashes (**//**). Instead, it is presented with a
"Replace" prompt:

[]{#_Toc527389262 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---Long Responses
Employing the "Replace\...With" Editor

ADDRESS 1: 1 Main Street Replace

The "Replace" prompt employs the "Replace\...With" Editor. At the
"Replace" prompt, you can revise some or all of the existing default
answer. To revise only a piece of the existing default response, type in
any series of letters that are part of the existing default answer that
you want to change and then press the **Enter** key. At the "With"
prompt, enter the series of characters to replace the original series,
and press the **Enter** key. At this point, the "Replace" prompt is
presented again, so that you can enter additional corrections. If you
are all done, however, just press the **Enter** key to finish working in
the field and move on to the next prompt.

For example:

[]{#_Toc527389263 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---Changing a Long
Response Using the "Replace\...With" Editor

ADDRESS 1: 1 Main Street Replace **Main \<Enter\>** With **North
\<Enter\>**

Replace **\<Enter\>**

1 North Street

ADDRESS 2:

To replace the entire default answer at a "Replace\...With" prompt,
simply enter **three** periods (**...**), called an ellipsis, at the
"Replace" prompt. You are then able to replace the entire default with
what you enter at the "With" prompt:

[]{#_Toc527389264 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---Replacing an
Entire Entry Using the Ellipsis (\...)

ADDRESS 1: 1 Main Street Replace **\... \<Enter\>** With **1 North
Street \<Enter\>**

Replace **\<Enter\>**

1 North Street

ADDRESS 2:

If you want to delete the entire text, enter the at-sign (**@**) at the
"Replace" prompt:

[]{#_Toc527389265 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---Deleting an
Entire Entry Using the At-Sign (@)

ADDRESS 1: 1 Main Street Replace **@ \<Enter\>**

SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE? **Y \<Enter\>** (Yes)

ADDRESS 2:

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** The at-sign (**@**) is the command in many
places to signal deletion.

### "Replace\..." Prompt Shortcuts

[Table 12]{.underline} lists shortcut responses when entering data at
the "Replace" prompt:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Shortcut         Action
  ---------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  **\...**         Replaces everything.

  **xxx\...**      Replaces everything starting from the characters
                   ***xxx*** to the end.

  **\...xxx**      Replaces everything from the beginning up to and
                   including the characters ***xxx***.

  **xxx\...yyy**   Replaces everything starting from ***xxx*** up to and
                   including ***yyy***.

  **end** or       Appends what you enter at the "With" prompt to the end
  **END**          of the value.

## Prompts with a List of Choices

If the acceptable answer to a field prompt is one of a set of choices,
you can display the list of choices by entering **one** or **two**
question marks. If that set of choices is short enough to be displayed
on five or six lines, the choices are listed when you enter **one**
question mark.

Here is an example:

[]{#_Toc527389266 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---Displaying a
List of Choices

Select PATIENT NAME: **?**

ANSWER WITH PATIENT NAME

CHOOSE FROM:

FMPATIENT,SEVEN

FMPATIENT,EIGHTEEN

FMPATIENT,NINETEEN

Answer must be 3-30 characters in length.

Select PATIENT NAME:

When you enter **one** question mark (**?**) and the entry list is long,
you are asked if you want to see all the entries. Besides a **YES** or
**NO** response, you can enter a caret (**\^**) followed by a string of
characters to see a list of all entries beginning with the one that
starts with those characters.

[Figure 63]{.underline} shows selection of an entry starting with an
alpha character:

[]{#_Ref389661492 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---Displaying a
Subset of Choices from a List

Select PATIENT NAME: **?**

ANSWER WITH PATIENT NAME, OR SSN

DO YOU WANT THE ENTIRE 1890-ENTRY PATIENT LIST? **\^F**

CHOOSE FROM:

FMPATIENT,20

FMPATIENT,21

FMPATIENT,22

FMPATIENT,23

'\^' TO STOP **\^**

YOU MAY ENTER A NEW PATIENT, IF YOU WISH

Enter patient name in "Last, First Middle" format \[3-30 characters\].

Select PATIENT NAME:

If you know the list is long and still want it to be displayed, you can
enter **two** question marks (**??**) to force the display of the entire
list.

## Key Fields

During a data entry session, VA FileMan checks that the combination of
fields that make up a key for a record is unique for all records in the
file. If a single field makes up a key, VA FileMan checks for uniqueness
as soon as that field is edited. If more than one field makes up a key
(i.e.,Â compound key), VA FileMan checks that the combination of new key
field values is unique only at the end of the data entry session (unless
otherwise instructed in the software code by the developer). If a
compound key is *not* unique, VA FileMan restores the fields that make
up the key to their pre-edited values, and prints a message.

For example:

[]{#_Toc527389268 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---Entering a
Duplicate Compound Key

Select ZZTEST NAME: **\`16 \<Enter\>** FMPATIENT,THREE 9900 SEP 03, 1932

ID NUMBER: 9900// **9800**

DATE: SEP 3,1932// **1/21/1932 \<Enter\>** (JAN 21, 1932)

\*\*\*\*\* NOTE \*\*\*\*\*

Some of the previous edits are not valid because they create one or more

duplicate keys. Some fields have been restored to their pre-edited

values.

Do you want to see a list of those fields? YES// **\<Enter\>**

The following field(s) have been restored to their pre-edited values:

File: ZZTEST File (#16999)

Key: A

Record: 'FMPATIENT,THREE' (#16)

Field: ID NUMBER(#1)

Invalid value: 9800

Restored to: 9900

Field: DATE (#2)

Invalid value: JAN 21, 1932

Restored to: SEP 03, 1932

## Special Responses to Field Prompts

### Deleting a Field's Value (@)

When you want to delete an answer previously entered, without
substituting any other answer, enter an at-sign (**@**) as a response to
that prompt:

[]{#_Toc527389269 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---Deleting a Field
Entry

DATE OF BIRTH: May 21, 1946// **@**

SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE? **YES**

In this example, the date on file would be erased: there is no answer to
the DATE OF BIRTH question; its value is now **NULL**. You are asked to
confirm the deletion; this gives you a chance to change your mind before
deleting the field.

### Jumping to another Field with the Caret (\^)

If you fail to notice a typing error until after you pressed the
**Enter** key and stored a field, you can still correct this error. What
you need to do is go back to the field where the error occurred. You can
usually accomplish this by using the *jump* command. This command
requires entering a caret (**\^**) along with the name, or first few
letters, of the field to which you wish to jump. Instead of moving to
the next prompt, you jump to the prompt you identified, as shown in
[Figure 66]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref523839079 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---Using the Caret
(\^) Key to "Jump" to a Specific Field

SSN: 000123123// **\^DATE OF BIRTH**

DATE OF BIRTH:

To get a list of the fields to which you can jump, enter a caret and a
question mark (**\^?**) at any field prompt.

You can use the caret to jump both forward and backward in a sequence of
fields.

![](output/images/media/image5.wmf) **TIP:** Sometimes, you may only
need to update one field in a record. You can jump directly to that
field once you start to edit that record. This can save time; you do not
need to go through every field and prompt that precedes the one you
want!

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** The caret (**\^**) is sometimes referred to
as the *up-arrow* in some legacy documentation.

### Exiting with the Single Caret (\^)

To exit or opt out of answering any question or prompt, enter the caret
(**\^**) by itself at the field prompt, as in [Figure 67]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref523840324 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---Using the Caret
(\^) Key to Exit a Prompt

SSN: 000123123// **\^**

Select PATIENT NAME:

In the previous example, the field value **000123123** remains
unchanged, but you skip the rest of the questions for this record and
return to the "Select\..." prompt. If you enter a caret (**\^**) at the
"Select\..." prompt, you return to the previous prompt, and so on.

Entering the caret (**\^**) by itself to exit a given function is a
convention used throughout VistA applications.

### Exiting with the Double Caret (\^\^)

When the user is doing a lookup to the file, VA FileMan may search many
indexes looking for a value that matches the users input. This can be
time consuming. If the user wants to get out of the lookup before VA
FileMan has completed the search, the user can enter two carets
(**\^\^**) at any prompt.

### Mandatory (Required) Fields

In some cases a field is *mandatory*, and you *must* enter a value, if
one is *not* already there; in other words, a **NULL** response
(i.e.,Â pressing the **Enter** key *without* making an entry) is *not*
valid. When you use the caret (**\^**) or press the **Enter** key
*without* entering data in one or more fields in the entry, your
terminal "beeps" and prompts you again to enter information.

If you do *not* fill in all required fields in a record, it is
considered incomplete, and is *not* stored unless you fill in the
required fields. This protects the database from records containing so
little information that they are useless. Enter the requested
information.

If you still need to exit before you can provide all required
information, you should abort your edit and start over later. You can
usually exit out of the data editing sequence by answering any of the
prompts with a caret (**\^**).

### Spacebar Recall

VA FileMan can recall your most recent response to a prompt. This
feature is called **Spacebar Recall** and employs the **Spacebar** and
**Enter** keys. For example, if you are editing a particular patient in
a Nursing application and then switch to the Order/Entry application to
work with the same patient, you can usually retrieve the same patient by
pressing the **Spacebar** *and* **Enter** keys
(**\<Spacebar\>\<Enter\>**) at the second application's (Order/Entry)
"Select PATIENT NAME:" prompt.

For example:

[]{#_Toc527389272 .anchor}Figure : VA FileMan Prompts---Using the
"Spacebar Recall" Functionality

Select PATIENT NAME: **\<Spacebar\>\<Enter\>**

FMPATIENT,24

NAME: FMPATIENT,24//

![](output/images/media/image5.wmf) **TIP:** You can use **Spacebar
Recall** throughout VA FileMan and the Kernel. Experiment with this
feature as a quick way to recall your last response to most prompts.

# Field Types

## Introduction

This document describes several fundamental VA FileMan conventions,
including:

-   When the cursor comes to rest in a field, the computer expects you
    to respond.

-   A field serves much the same purpose as a blank on a form.

-   Each field has a prompt that identifies your response's subject
    matter.

-   You have a number of tools available to you at field prompts,
    including the:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Caret (**\^**) jump.

-   Default response.

-   "Replace\...With" editor.

-   Spacebar Recall (**\<Spacebar\>\<Enter\>**).

-   At-sign (**@**) deletion.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Some fields have additional restrictions, such as your response's
    length or format. Enter **one** or **two** question marks (**?** or
    **??**) to retrieve help on what is an acceptable entry for a
    particular field.

When you are editing a field, entering **one** question mark (**?**) at
the field prompt usually provides enough help to infer what kind of
field you have reached and to predict what kind of data is acceptable in
this field (i.e.,Â DATA TYPE field value).

You do *not* need to know a lot about these DATA TYPE field values, but
a little information can be helpful. In the sections that follow, you
will find examples and brief explanations about each field type
(i.e.,Â DATA TYPE field value). In VA FileMan, you will work with many,
if not all, of the following DATA TYPE field values:

-   [DATE/TIME](#datetime-fields)

-   [NUMERIC](#numeric-fields)

-   [SET OF CODES](#set-of-codes-fields)

-   [FREE TEXT](#free-text-fields)

-   [WORD-PROCESSING](#word-processing-fields)

-   [COMPUTED](#computed-fields-1)

-   [POINTER TO A FILE](#pointer-to-a-file-fields)

-   [VARIABLE-POINTER](#variable-pointer-fields)

-   [BOOLEAN](#boolean-fields)

-   [LABEL REFERENCE](#label-reference-fields)

-   [TIME](#time-fields)

-   [YEAR](#year-fields)

-   [UNIVERSAL TIME](#universal-time-fields)

-   [FT POINTER](#ft-pointer-fields)

-   [FT DATE](#ft-date-fields)

-   [RATIO](#ratio-fields)

In addition, [Subfiles (Multiples)](#subfiles-multiples) are introduced
at the end of this section.

## DATE/TIME Fields

You can use a variety of formats when entering dates. For example, a
DATA TYPE field value of DATE/TIME would probably be used to hold a
patient's birthdate:

[]{#_Toc527389274 .anchor}Figure : Field Types---Entering a Date at a
DATE/TIME Field

DATE OF BIRTH: MAR 3, 1955

With a DATE/TIME field type, as with all field types, entering a
question mark retrieves help on acceptable responses. Enter **one**
question mark (**?**) at a DATE/TIME field prompt and you are given help
about what dates are acceptable for the particular field and what
precision of date is needed (e.g.,Â year, month, day, or time).

### Acceptable Formats for Entering Dates

The following are acceptable formats for entering dates:

-   JULY 20, 1999 ***or*** July 20, 1999

-   7/20/99

-   20 JUL 99

-   10jul99

-   10 jul 99

-   072099

To simplify entering dates, you can use shortcuts such as:

-   **T** for today

-   **T-1** for yesterday

-   **T+1** for tomorrow

You can also combine **T** with other shortcuts:

-   **D** for day. For example, **T-2D** means **two** days ago.

-   **W** for week. For example, **T+1W** means today plus **one** week.

-   **M** for month. For example, **T+4M** means **four** months from
    today.

The year portion of the date can be left off. Normally, VA FileMan
assumes the current year. Sometimes, you can input imprecise dates such
as "**JUL 99**" or "**1999**".

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** VA FileMan is Year 2000 (Y2K) compliant.

### Abbreviations for Dates

[Table 13]{.underline} lists acceptable abbreviations when entering
dates:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Abbreviation                        Meaning
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  **TODAY** or **Today** or **T** or  Today.
  **t**                               

  **TODAY+1** or **T+1** or **t+1**   Tomorrow.

  **TODAY-7** or **T-7** or **t-7**   One week ago.

  **TODAY+3W** or **T+3W** or         Three weeks hence.
  **t+3w**                            
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  : []{#_Ref345583002 .anchor}Table : Field Types---Abbreviations for
  Times

### Times in DATE/TIME Fields

In some DATE/TIME fields, you can enter a time-of-day along with the
date. For example, to indicate **4:00 PM on July 20, 1999**, enter the
date in one of the formats shown in Section [7.2.1]{.underline},
"[Acceptable Formats for Entering Dates]{.underline}," followed by an
at-sign (**@**), and then followed by the time.

For example, you might enter:

[]{#_Toc527389275 .anchor}Figure : Field Types---Entering a Date and
Time

APPOINTMENT: **20 JUL 99@4PM**

To be totally unambiguous, you can enter time in any of the following
formats:

-   Military time (**four** or **six** digits, no colon)

-   hour AM/PM, hour:minute AM/PM

-   hour:minute:second AM/PM

If you do omit an AM/PM notation, the following assumptions are made:

-   If you enter **one** digit for the hour, a time between **6AM** and
    **6PM** is used. Thus, **T@330** (or **T@3:30**) means **today at
    3:30 PM** and **T@945** (or **T@9:45**) means **today at 9:45 AM**.

-   If you enter **two** digits for the hour, the actual hour entered is
    used (as if military time were being used). Thus, **T@0330** (or
    **T@03:30**) means **today at 3:30 AM**.

As with dates, there are supported abbreviations you can use when
entering times in DATE/TIME fields. For example:

-   To enter the present moment, you can enter the word **NOW**.

-   To enter an hour from the present moment, enter **NOW+1H**.

-   To enter an hour ago from the present moment, enter **NOW-1H**.

-   You can combine **NOW** with **D** for day and **M** for month and
    **'** (apostrophe) for minute.

-   You can enter **MID** for **12 a.m.** and **NOON** for **12 p.m.**

### Abbreviations for Times

[Table 14]{.underline} lists acceptable abbreviations when entering
time:

  ---------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  Abbreviation     Meaning

  **NOW+3'**       Present time plus **three** minutes.

  **NOW+1H**       Present time plus **one** hour.

  **NOW+3D**       Present time plus **three** days.

  **NOW+4M**       Present time plus **four** months.

  **NOON**         Today at **12:00 noon**.

  **MID**          Today at **24:00 midnight**.

## NUMERIC Fields

DATA TYPE field values of NUMERIC work very much like [FREE
TEXT](#free-text-fields) fields, except that input is restricted to
valid numbers. There can also be restrictions as to how small or large a
number is allowed, and how many decimal places are allowed. Entering
**one** question mark retrieves help that tells you what responses are
acceptable.

For example, a NUMERIC field type would probably be used to store the
height of a patient:

[]{#_Toc527389276 .anchor}Figure : Field Types---Example of a NUMERIC
Field

HEIGHT (cm): 196

## SET OF CODES Fields

DATA TYPE field values of SET OF CODES (sometimes referred to as a SET)
are preset to accept coded information. The codes are usually only
**one** or **two** characters long. Each code in a SET represents a word
or a series of words. For example, the codes **Y** and **N** often
represent the words **YES** and **NO**. You can enter the code at this
prompt instead of the entire word. If, however, you enter anything other
than an acceptable code (or the word it represents), the computer
rejects your response.

To see a list of acceptable codes, simply enter **one** question mark
(**?**) in response to the prompt.

[Figure 73]{.underline} shows how a SET OF CODES field type is used to
store whether or not a patient is a smoker:

[]{#_Ref389661523 .anchor}Figure : Field Types---Example of a SET OF
CODES Field

Select PATIENT NAME: **FMPATIENT,NINE**

SMOKER: **?**

Choose from:

S SMOKER

N NON-SMOKER

SMOKER: **N \<Enter\>** NON-SMOKER

In the example in [Figure 73]{.underline}, there were two choices for
the user to select for the \"SMOKER\" field.

### Internal vs. External Values for SET OF CODES Fields

In [Figure 73]{.underline}, the value of the SMOKER field is set to
**N**, which is the code for **NON-SMOKER**. In this case:

-   **N**---Internal value of the field (the form in which it is stored
    in the database).

-   **NON-SMOKER**---External value of the field (the form in which it
    is displayed on screen and in reports).

Every DATA TYPE field value has an internal and external value; in most
cases, however, the internal and external values are the same. SET OF
CODES field types are an exception.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** Probably, the only place you need to know
the distinction between internal and external values is when you print a
report and *sort* on a SET OF CODES-valued field. The sort order is
based on the internal values (codes) if you sort on a SET OF
CODES-valued field.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information on printing and
sorting, see the "[Print]{.underline}" section.

## FREE TEXT Fields

You can enter almost any character from your keyboard in a DATA TYPE
field value of FREE TEXT. The computer accepts numbers, letters, and
most of the symbols that can be entered. The FREE TEXT field type places
a restriction on the number of characters that you can enter. If you
enter **one** question mark (**?**) in response to the prompt for a FREE
TEXT-valued field, you learn how many characters you are allowed to
enter.

For example, a FREE TEXT field type would probably be used to hold a
patient's street address:

[]{#_Toc527389278 .anchor}Figure : Field Types---Example of a FREE TEXT
Field

ADDRESS: 123 Main Street

In some places, even though the field is FREE TEXT, checks are applied
to make sure what is entered matches a certain format. For example, if
you are entering a Social Security Number, which is stored as a DATA
TYPE field value of FREE TEXT, *not* NUMERIC, your input would typically
be checked to make sure it is **nine** characters in length and contains
all digits:

[]{#_Toc527389279 .anchor}Figure : Field Types---Example of a FREE TEXT
Field with Validation

SSN: **abcde \<Enter\>** ??

ANSWER MUST BE 9 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH

SSN: **99999 \<Enter\>** ??

ANSWER MUST BE 9 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH

SSN: **33233290 \<Enter\>** ??

ANSWER MUST BE 9 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH

SSN: **000232343**

DATE:

## WORD-PROCESSING Fields

DATA TYPE field values of WORD-PROCESSING can contain unlimited amounts
of text data, and are suitable for things like mail messages, physician
notes, and descriptions. Because of their special nature, VA FileMan
provides special tools for entering and editing data into this kind of a
field.

Two editors for editing WORD-PROCESSING field types are provided with VA
FileMan (and described in their own section):

-   [Screen Editor]{.underline}

-   [Line Editor]{.underline}

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** To set your default editor, see the
"[Word-Processing Fields]{.underline}" section. This section also
explains how you can switch your current editor on-the-fly. For most
people, the Screen Editor should be your Preferred Editor for
WORD-PROCESSING fields.

When you encounter a WORD-PROCESSING field type, if your default editor
is the Screen Editor, a portion of any existing text is displayed, and
you are prompted "Edit? NO//":

[]{#_Toc527389280 .anchor}Figure : Field Types---Example of a
WORD-PROCESSING Field, Using the Screen Editor

Select PATIENT NAME: **FMPATIENT,22**

NAME: FMPATIENT,22// **\<Enter\>**

SEX: MALE// **\<Enter\>**

DATE OF BIRTH: AUG 22,1948// **\<Enter\>**

HISTORY:

Owing to poverty in early youth, patient seems not to

have had proper diet. Since achieving economic success,

his diet has been adequate, but traces of original

deficiency remain.

Edit? NO//

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information on the Screen Editor,
see the "[Screen Editor]{.underline}" section.

When you encounter a WORD-PROCESSING field type, if your default editor
is the [Line Editor]{.underline} on the other hand, a portion of the
text is displayed, and you are prompted with "Edit Option:"

[]{#_Toc527389281 .anchor}Figure : Field Types---Example of a

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information on the Line Editor, see
the "[Line Editor]{.underline}" section.

## COMPUTED Fields

DATA TYPE field values of COMPUTED are typically used to output a value
computed at run-time in a report. You *cannot* edit the value of a
COMPUTED field type.

An example of a COMPUTED field type would be a field that calculated age
based on today's date and a patient's DATE OF BIRTH field. Because the
field is a COMPUTED field type, it can output a patient's current age
based on whatever today's date is. You *cannot* edit the AGE field, but
you can use it to print out the current age of the patient.

You are most likely to come across COMPUTED field types when printing
with the CAPTIONED PRINT template. Choosing the CAPTIONED OUTPUT
template automatically outputs all normal fields containing data for
each entry in a report. However, you *must* choose whether you want
COMPUTED fields included in the output as well, as shown in [Figure
78]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref345588399 .anchor}Figure : Field Types---Dialogue to Choose a
COMPUTED Field: Sample User Entries at Prompts

STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT? Yes// **\<Enter\>** (Yes)

Include COMPUTED fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO// **?**

Enter a code from the list.

Select one of the following:

N NO - No record number (IEN), no Computed Fields

Y Computed Fields

R Record Number (IEN)

B BOTH Computed Fields and Record Number (IEN)

At the \"Include COMPUTED fields: (N/Y/R/B): NO//\" prompt, you choose
whether to output COMPUTED fields.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information on CAPTIONED OUTPUT,
see the "[Inquire]{.underline}" and "[Print]{.underline}" sections.

## POINTER TO A FILE Fields

A DATA TYPE field value of POINTER TO A FILE is a field that directs the
computer to another file for information. If you are working in the
PATIENT (#2) file, for example, and you have reached a field that asks
for the patient's STATE, the field is probably a POINTER TO A FILE field
that "points" to the STATE (#5) file. Because of pointers, such commonly
used information as states can be stored in a single STATE (#5) file.
Then, every file (e.g.,Â PATIENT, VENDOR, INSURANCE, etc.) that needs to
record a value for STATE can use a POINTER TO A FILE field to the STATE
(#5) file to store that information.

For example:

[]{#_Toc527389283 .anchor}**Figure 79:** Field Types---**Sample of a
POINTER TO A FILE Field (1 of 2)**

![Field Types---Sample of a POINTER TO A FILE
field](output/images/media/image9.jpeg){width="6.5in"
height="2.9479166666666665in"}

[]{#_Toc527389284 .anchor}Figure . Field Types---Sample of a POINTER TO
A FILE Field (2 of 2)

INPUT TO WHAT FILE: PATIENT// **\<Enter\>** (1890 entries)

EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// **STATE**

THEN EDIT FIELD: **\<Enter\>**

Select PATIENT NAME: **FMPATIENT,THREE**

STATE: **??**

CHOOSE FROM:

ALABAMA

ALASKA

ARIZONA

.

.

.

STATE: **COLORADO**

Enter **two** question marks at the "STATE:" prompt to list available
choices. If the choice you need is *not* listed, you can add that choice
by typing it in (provided you have **LAYGO** access to add the entry).
If the entry you enter is *not* matched, you are asked if you want to
add a new entry. If you answer **YES**, VA FileMan adds the new entry.
For example, if there was a state that did *not* have an entry in the
STATE (#5) file, you could add it by entering it at the "STATE:" prompt.

## VARIABLE-POINTER Fields

A DATA TYPE field value of VARIABLE-POINTER is like the regular [POINTER
TO A FILE](#pointer-to-a-file-fields) field type, with one difference:

The VARIABLE-POINTER DATA TYPE can point to a single record in one of
*several* files; whereas the regular POINTER TO A FILE DATA TYPE can
point to a single record in only *one* file.

The PATIENT (#2) file, for example, might use a VARIABLE-POINTER field
type to identify a provider; the provider might be a Staff Provider,
stored in the (fictitious) PROVIDER file, or an outside provider, stored
in another file.

For example, if you are working in a PATIENT (#2) file entry, and you
need information that explains how to look up a name listed in one of
several files. To get help, simply enter a single question mark (**?**)
at the "PROVIDER" prompt. The system then displays instructions that
explain how to choose a provider from either of the two files being
pointed to, as shown in [Figure 81]{.underline}.

[]{#_Ref345588409 .anchor}Figure : Field Types---Dialogue Showing Help
for Entries in a VARIABLE-POINTER Field: Sample User Entries at Prompts

PROVIDER: **?**

Enter one of the following:

S.EntryName to select a Staff Provider

O.EntryName to select an Outside Provider

To see the entries in any particular file, type \<Prefix.?\>

Entering one question mark at the "PROVIDER:" prompt displays online
help that shows what prefixes are used to refer to entries in each
pointed to file.

With VARIABLE-POINTER field types, you need to use a PREFIX in addition
to an entry name to select an entry. In this example, the online help
tells you that:

-   To select a Staff Provider, prefix the provider's name with
    "**S.**".

-   To select an Outside Provider, prefix the provider's name with
    "**O.**".

You can enter a PREFIX and **one** question mark to get a list of
entries in a particular pointed-to file. For example, if you enter
"**S.?**" you can get a list of all Staff Providers. Likewise, you can
enter "**S.FMPROVIDER**" to get a list of all Staff Providers whose last
names are **FMPROVIDER**. You can also enter "**S.FMPROVIDER,ONE**" to
select a Staff Provider named **One Fmprovider**.

For example:

[]{#_Toc527389286 .anchor}Figure : Field Types---Using the PREFIX and a
Question Mark to Get a List of Entries in a Pointed-To File

PROVIDER: **S.?**

CHOOSE FROM:

FMPROVIDER,ONE

FMPROVIDER,TWO

:

You can also select an entry in a VARIABLE-POINTER field by just
entering a name *without* the PREFIX. In this case, VA FileMan searches
each pointed-to file in succession until a match is found.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** This method requires more processing time,
since VA FileMan needs to search the various pointed-to files.

For example, to choose a provider *without* specifying in which file the
provider can be found, enter the provider name only:

[]{#_Toc527389287 .anchor}Figure : Field Types---Searching for an Entry
in a Pointed-To File

PROVIDER: **FMPROVIDER,EIGHT M**

Searching for a Staff Provider

Searching for a Outside Provider FMPROVIDER,EIGHT M

\...OK? YES// **\<Enter\>** (YES)

You can add an entry to one of the files that is being pointed to by a
VARIABLE-POINTER field. To do this, enter the appropriate PREFIX and the
new name to add at the field prompt.

For example, to add "**FMPROVIDER,EIGHT M**" as an Outside Provider
(*not* a Staff Provider), use the appropriate PREFIX when adding the new
entry (in this case, "**O.**"). When the requested name is *not* found,
you are asked if you want to add the provider as a new entry. To add the
entry, enter **YES**:

[]{#_Toc527389288 .anchor}Figure : Field Types---Adding a New Entry to a
Pointed-To File

PROVIDER: **O.FMPROVIDER,EIGHT M.**

Are you adding 'FMPROVIDER,EIGHT M.' as a new OUTSIDE PROVIDER? No//
**YES \<Enter\>** (Yes)

OUTSIDE PROVIDER SEX: **MALE**

OUTSIDE PROVIDER DATE OF BIRTH: **020235 \<Enter\>** (FEB 02, 1935)

OUTSIDE PROVIDER SSN: **000987321**

## Subfiles (Multiples)

Sometimes, a single field in a record is *not* enough to hold all the
information required. For example, to keep track of the appointment
history for a patient, a single field would *not* be enough. An ordinary
field could only hold enough information to record a single appointment.
But there needs to be a way to record as many appointments as a patient
has had, which could range from none to several hundred. In addition,
each appointment might have its own information that needs to be stored
(e.g.,Â date, time, location, doctor, etc.).

This situation is handled with what are known as Subfiles (also known as
Multiples). Within an individual record, a Subfile (Multiple) can be
used to hold this type of information:

[]{#_Ref491174811 .anchor}Figure : Field Types---Sample Subfile

height="3.566666666666667in"}

The fields in a Subfile (in this example \[[Figure 85]{.underline}\],
DATE, TIME, LOCATION, and DOCTOR) are called Subfields.

The word "**Select**" is always the first part of the prompt when you
encounter a Multiple, to indicate that you are choosing among one of
several possible values on file, as shown in [Figure 86]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref504485476 .anchor}Figure : Field Types---Example of a Multiple
Field Prompt

Select APPOINTMENTS:

If, for a given Multiple, more than one entry has already been entered,
the most recently created entry is displayed as a default. To see the
list of entries already in the Multiple, enter **two** question marks
(**??**) at the "Select\..." prompt.

Because they are so useful, Subfiles (Multiples) are widely used
throughout VistA. They are usually straightforward to use, because their
structure as Subfiles mirrors the real-world structure of the
information. For example, for a purchase order, the top-level record
would be the purchase order. Because a single purchase order needs a
place to store as few or as many items as are requested, the purchase
order record has a Multiple to record the order items for the purchase
order.

Subfiles can themselves contain Subfiles creating additional levels in
files.

# Adding and Deleting Records

## .01 Field

The **.01** field is the most important field in a file. For the records
in a file, it usually identifies the record more than any other single
field. For example, the **.01** field of the PATIENT (#2) file is NAME.
The **.01** field of a WARD file might be WARD NAME.

Usually, in an edit dialogue the **.01** field is the field you are
prompted for when you choose a record to edit. Typically, it is also the
first field you actually edit once you have chosen the record.

The **.01** field plays a role in both adding and deleting entries in a
file:

-   To *add* an entry to a file, you usually enter a new value at the
    **.01** field's prompt.

-   To *delete* an entry to a file, you usually enter an at-sign (**@**)
    in the entry's **.01** field.

## How to Add a Record

As you recall from the "[Introduction]{.underline}", an entry is a
complete record in a file. To *add* a new entry to a file, enter the
name of the new entry at the "Select\..." prompt where you ordinarily
choose which record in the file to edit:

[]{#_Ref345588419 .anchor}Figure : Records---Dialogue to Add a Record:
Sample User Entries at Prompts

Select PATIENT NAME: **FMPATIENT,ONE**

ARE YOU ADDING 'FMPATIENT,ONE' AS A NEW PATIENT (THE 121082ND)? No// **Y
\<Enter\>** (Yes)

This is the prompt for the record's **.01** field (see [Figure
87]{.underline}). If you enter a name that does *not* exist in the file,
you are prompted "Are you adding *'XXXXXXXX*' as a new '*ENTRY*'?";
where "*XXXXXXXX*" represents the field value and "ENTRY" represents the
field or file name. If **LAYGO** is allowed and you answer **YES** to
this prompt, VA FileMan adds the new entry to the file. You then go on
to edit other fields for the new entry.

If a file has one or more data Keys defined (i.e.,Â fields or
combinations of fields that uniquely identify a record), then those
fields *must* also be filled in before the new entry is added. There
*must not* be any other records on the file that have the same values in
all of those fields.

Finally, there may be a set of required fields (identifiers) for the new
entry; these *must* be filled in with values for the new entry to be
saved.

## Adding a Duplicate Record (Use Quotes)

What if there is already a "**FMPATIENT,ONE**" in the PATIENT (#2) file,
and you need to add a second entry with the same name
"**FMPATIENT,ONE**"? Simply entering that name at the "Select\..."
prompt selects the existing entry. To create a *second*
**FMPATIENT,ONE** entry, even though one with that name *already*
exists, enter the entry name you want to add, but with *quotation marks*
around it, as shown in [Figure 88]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref345588428 .anchor}Figure : Records---Dialogue to Add a Duplicate
Record: Sample User Entries at Prompts

Select PATIENT NAME: **"FMPATIENT,ONE"**

ARE YOU ADDING 'FMPATIENT,ONE' AS A NEW PATIENT (THE 121082ND)? No// **Y
\<Enter\>** (Yes)

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For instructions on adding entries with the
same name to pointed-to files from a POINTER TO A FILE data type field,
see the "[Adding Records at a POINTER TO A FILE
Field](#adding-records-to-a-pointer-to-a-file-field)" section.

If a record has a data Key defined (i.e.,Â fields or combinations of
fields that uniquely identify a record), and if the data Key contains
more than one field, then it would be possible to add a second
**FMPATIENT,ONE** *without* using quotes. Suppose the Key fields were
the NAME and the DATE OF BIRTH. Then the user would be prompted for both
NAME and DATE OF BIRTH, and assuming that the DATE OF BIRTH of the
second **FMPATIENT,ONE** were different from the existing record, VA
FileMan would allow the user to add the new **FMPATIENT,ONE** *without*
enclosing the name in quotes.

## How to Delete a Record

To delete an existing record in a file, enter an at-sign (**@**) in the
record's **.01** field. This tells VA FileMan to delete the record. In
all deletions, you are asked to confirm the deletion before VA FileMan
goes ahead and deletes the record. [Figure 89]{.underline} is an example
of deleting a record in a file:

[]{#_Ref345588440 .anchor}Figure : Records---Dialogue to Delete a
Record: Sample User Entries at Prompts

Select DOCTOR NAME: **FMDOCTOR,TWO**

NAME: FMDOCTOR,TWO// **@**

ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THE ENTIRE 'FMDOCTOR,TWO" DOCTOR?
**YES**

In this example, the user entered an at-sign (**@**) at the DOCTOR NAME
(#.01) field to delete the entire entry for the **FMDOCTOR,TWO**.

## Repointing When Deleting Records

What if a record in another file points to the record you are deleting?

If you delete a record that is pointed to from another file, this would
leave a dangling pointer that points to a *non*-existent entry. To
prevent this, if the record you delete could be pointed to from another
file, you are given the opportunity to either delete any pointers to the
deleted record, or change them all to point to another record.

For example, an entry in the PATIENT (#2) file may have a field that
points to a doctor in the (fictitious) PROVIDER file. If you delete the
doctor from the (fictitious) PROVIDER file, you should indicate what
should happen to any entries in other files, including the PATIENT (#2)
file that points to this doctor.

In the example in [Figure 90]{.underline}, when you delete the
**FMDOCTOR,TWELVE** record, you also re-points any entries that had been
pointing to **FMDOCTOR,TWELVE** to point to **FMDOCTOR,EIGHT**.

[]{#_Ref345588452 .anchor}**Figure 90:** Records---**Dialogue to Delete
a Record and Re-Point to a Different Record**: Sample User Entries at
Prompts

Select DOCTOR NAME: **FMDOCTOR,TWELVE**

NAME: FMDOCTOR,TWELVE// **@**

ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THE ENTIRE 'FMDOCTOR,TWELVE" DOCTOR?
**YES**

SINCE THE DELETED ENTRY MAY HAVE BEEN 'POINTED TO' BY ENTRIES IN THE
'PATIENT' FILE, ETC., DO YOU WANT THOSE POINTERS UPDATED (WHICH COULD
TAKE QUITE A WHILE)? NO// **Y \<Enter\>** (YES)

WHICH DO YOU WANT TO DO?

1\) DELETE ALL SUCH POINTERS

2\) CHANGE ALL SUCH POINTERS TO POINT TO A DIFFERENT 'DOCTOR' ENTRY

CHOOSE 1) OR 2): **2**

THEN PLEASE INDICATE WHICH ENTRY SHOULD BE POINTED TO

Select DOCTOR NAME: **FMDOCTOR,EIGHT**

-OK? YES// **Y \<Enter\>** (YES)

(RE-POINTING WILL OCCUR WHEN YOU LEAVE ENTER/EDIT OPTION)

When you leave the **Enter or Edit File Entries** \[DIEDIT\] option, the
updating is done. A report is generated listing all changed entries; you
need to specify on what device this report should be listed:

[]{#_Ref345588470 .anchor}Figure : Records---Dialogue Showing a Report
of Changed Entries: Sample Report

...EXCUSE ME, LET ME PUT YOU ON 'HOLD' FOR A SECOND\...

DEVICE: HOME// **\<Enter\>** SYSTEM

PATIENT ENTRIES WHOSE 'ATTENDING PHYSICIAN' POINTERS HAVE BEEN CHANGED

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FMPATIENT,TWENTY

FMPATIENT,ONE

FMPATIENT,ELEVEN

FMPATIENT,SEVEN

Select OPTION:

In this case ([Figure 91]{.underline}), four entries are found that had
**FMDOCTOR,TWELVE** as their doctor. Now that **FMDOCTOR,TWELVE** was
deleted, these records are re-pointed to **FMDOCTOR,EIGHT**.

## Adding Records to a POINTER TO A FILE Field

Suppose you are editing a POINTER TO A FILE-type field. This lets you
choose an entry from another file to point to. If you have
**Learn-As-You-Go** (**LAYGO**) access to the pointed-to file, you can
also *add* new entries to it when editing the POINTER TO A FILE field.

For example, suppose you are editing the TITLE (#8) field in the NEW
PERSON (#200) file, which is a POINTER TO A FILE type field that
"points" to the TITLE (#3.1) file. What if you want to choose a TITLE
that is *not* already in the TITLE (#3.1) file? You can add it as in the
example shown in [Figure 92]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref345588479 .anchor}Figure : Records---Dialogue to Add a New Entry
to a Pointed-To File: Sample User Entries at Prompts

NAME: FMUSER,ONE// **\<Enter\>**

.

.

.

TITLE: **??**

This is the title for the new person.

Choose from:

ACCOUNTANT

ACCOUNTANT/TRAINEE

ACCOUNTING TECHNICIAN

ACCOUNTING TECHNICIAN (OA)

ACCOUNTS MAINT CLERK (OA)

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ASSISTANT

ACOS/AMBULATORY CARE

ADDICTION THERAPIST

ADJUDICATOR

ADMIN OFFICER

ADMIN SUPPORT ASSISTANT

ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT

ADMINISTRATIVE INTERN

ADMINISTRATIVE LIBRARIAN

ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER

AIR COND EQUIP MECHANIC

ANESTHESIOLOGIST

**\^**

You may enter a new TITLE, if you wish

ANSWER MUST BE 3-30 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH

TITLE: **OIT STAFF**

Are you adding 'OIT STAFF' as a new TITLE (the 750TH)? No// **Y
\<Enter\>** (Yes)

TITLE OCCUPATION CODE: **2210**

SSN: 000111659// **\<Enter\>**

.

.

.

In this example, after adding **OIT STAFF** as a new entry, if you go
back to the TITLE field and enter **two** question marks (**??**) again
and scroll through the list, **OIT STAFF** would be one of the choices
listed for TITLE.

### Adding Duplicate-Named Entries

You can force an entry to be added to the pointed-to file, even if an
entry with the same value already exists in the pointed-to file. To add
a duplicate-named entry, surround the value to be added with **one** set
of quotation marks, like [Figure 93]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref523490331 .anchor}Figure : Records---Adding a Duplicate-Named
Entry to a Pointed-To File

POINTER FIELD: **"FORCED NEW ENTRY"**

If the POINTER TO A FILE field that you are editing happens to be the
NAME (#.01) field of the current file, you can add entries to both the
current file and to the pointed-to file by surrounding your value with
**two** sets of quotation marks as shown in [Figure 94]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref523490387 .anchor}Figure : Records---Adding an Entry to Both the
Current File and to a Pointed-To File

POINTER FIELD (.01): **""FORCED NEW ENTRY""**

## Adding and Deleting from Multiples

Some special considerations apply when you are editing Multiple-valued
fields. One example of a Multiple field is the DIAGNOSIS field in the
PATIENT (#2) file. As you recall from the "[Field Types]{.underline}"
section, a Multiple is a field in a record that can store multiple
subrecords. In this case, VA FileMan *must* be able to store multiple
diagnosis entries for a single patient, and it uses a Multiple field to
do so:

[]{#_Ref345588487 .anchor}Figure : Records---Dialogue Showing Entries to
a Multiple Field: Sample User Entries at Prompts

Select PATIENT NAME: **FMPATIENT,NINE**

NAME: FMPATIENT,NINE // **\<Enter\>**

PATIENT DATE OF BIRTH: 4/19/49// **\<Enter\>**

Select DIAGNOSIS: **??**

1 ANGINA PECTORIS

2 PNEUMONIA

You may enter a new DIAGNOSIS, if you wish

Select DIAGNOSIS: **ANGINA PECRORIS**

DIAGNOSIS: ANGINA PECTORIS// **\<Enter\>**

AGE AT ONSET: **25**

HISTORY:

1\) **\<Enter\>**

EDIT OPTION: **\<Enter\>**

Select DIAGNOSIS: **\<Enter\>**

Select PATIENT NAME:

Multiples have **.01** fields, just like records at the top-level of a
file. Thus, just as with records at the top-level of a file, you select
entries in the Multiple at the Multiple's "Select\..." prompt. You can
also add a new entry by typing it in at the Multiple's "Select\..."
prompt. You can delete an entry in a Multiple by entering an at-sign
(**@**) in the existing entry's **.01** field.

Enter **one** question mark (**?**) at a Multiple's "Select\..." prompt
to retrieve brief help for the field; enter **two** question marks
(**??**) to choose from the list of entries in the Multiple.

## Enter or Edit File Entries Option

In most cases you enter and edit data through application programs.
Applications are pre-programmed to allow you to edit specific files, and
often only a subset of the fields in any given file. The application
shields you from many aspects of editing the file data, such as even
knowing the name of the file with which you are working. Usually, this
information is already chosen for you by the application.

You can also edit data in a file directly, however, using VA FileMan's
**Enter or Edit File Entries** \[DIEDIT\] option. Your ability to edit
data in any given file depends on:

-   Whether you have the **Enter or Edit File Entries** \[DIEDIT\]
    option on your menu.

-   Whether you have access to edit the file in question.

The steps to use the **Enter or Edit File Entries** \[DIEDIT\] option
are:

1.  At the "INPUT TO WHAT FILE:" prompt, choose which file to edit. To
    see what files you have access to, you can enter two question marks
    (**??**) at this prompt:

> []{#_Toc527389300 .anchor}Figure : Records---Choosing a File to Edit

INPUT TO WHAT FILE:**??**

Choose from:

335235 FMUSER'S DATA (7 entries)

335238 PROJECTS (3 entries)

335668 WARD HISTORY (178 entries)

INPUT TO WHAT FILE: **PROJECTS**

22. []{#_Hlt445540463 .anchor}At the "EDIT WHICH FIELD:" prompt, choose
    what fields to edit for each file entry. The easiest response is to
    just accept the default of **ALL** fields by pressing the **Enter**
    key:

> []{#_Toc527389301 .anchor}Figure : Records---Choosing the File Fields
> to Edit

EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL//

If, however, you want to edit only *certain fields* (*not all* fields),
answer the "EDIT WHICH FIELD:" prompt with the name (or number) of the
*first* field you want to edit. You can then enter additional fields to
edit (when you are done, press the **Enter** key at the "THEN EDIT
FIELD:" prompt). For a list of fields that you can edit, enter **two**
question marks at any "EDIT FIELD:" prompt.

> []{#_Toc527389302 .anchor}Figure : Records---Choosing Specific File

THEN EDIT FIELD: **PROJECT SHORT DESCRIPTION**

THEN EDIT FIELD: **PROJECT ISSUE \<Enter\>** (multiple)

Select PROJECTS NAME:

23. You can now edit entries. Choose each entry to edit at the
    "Select\...NAME:" prompt. Each time you choose an entry, you step
    through each field you specified in [Step 2](#_Hlt445540463). When
    you are done with editing an entry, you are prompted for another
    entry to edit at the "Select\..." prompt. When you are done editing
    entries, just press the **Enter** key.

# ScreenMan

ScreenMan is VA FileMan's *screen-oriented* data entry tool. It is an
alternative to the Scrolling Mode approach. With ScreenMan, data is
entered in *forms*. Each form field occupies a fixed position on the
screen (instead of scrolling off!). You can see many data fields at once
and use simple key combinations to edit data and move from field to
field on a screen. You can also move from one screen to another; like
turning through the pages of a book.

## Scrolling Mode Editing vs. Screen Mode Editing

### Similarities

The following are similarities when editing in Scrolling Mode and Screen
Mode:

-   You can change a field's value by entering a different value or
    delete a field's value by entering the at-sign (**@**).

-   You can enter one or two question marks to call up a list of
    acceptable responses and other help. If you enter a value deemed
    unacceptable, ScreenMan displays a message explaining what type of
    information should be entered.

-   You can jump from the current field to any other field in your
    current screen. With your cursor resting at any field's prompt,
    simply enter a caret (**\^**) and then the name of the field.

### Differences

The following are differences when editing in Scrolling Mode and Screen
Mode:

-   In Scrolling Mode, you *must* enter and store your response to one
    field prompt before you can continue to the next field. In Screen
    Mode, you can move the cursor from field prompt to field prompt
    without entering or storing any responses.

-   In Scrolling Mode, your data values or responses to field prompts
    are stored one at a time, as you move from prompt to prompt. In
    Screen Mode, your responses to most prompts are stored only when you
    exit the form.

-   The "Customize Colors" suboption within ScreenMan allows selection
    of ANSI colors for all ScreenMan presentations, on a parameterized
    basis (user, institution, etc.) using Kernel parameters.

-   The "ScreenMan Record Selection" page can now be a full ScreenMan
    page using a COMPUTED Multiple pointer, so that the user can select
    an entry by scrolling up or down. This feature lets forms contain
    embedded lookups.

-   You can set this up automatically when you create a form. At the
    query "Do you want you're Form to begin with a display of all
    entries, for selection," answer **YES**. The initial position can be
    set to be the user's last selection, rather than first, last, or
    new.

-   ScreenMan supports the use of a mouse for emulators that support
    ANSI standard control sequences to turn the mouse on and off.
    However, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has elected to turn
    this feature off due to support complications with Attachmate^Â®^ and
    Micro Focus^Â®^ Reflection terminal emulator software. The **DI
    SCREENMAN NO MOUSE** parameter needs to be established for SYSTEM
    and set to **YES**.

In this screen capture, you see the following highlighted areas on a
sample ScreenMan form:

-   Required Fields are [underlined]{.underline}.

-   Current field where the cursor is active are shown in reverse video
    (i.e.,Â white text on black background), such as at the "NICK NAME:"
    field.

-   Command Area below the line is where ScreenMan displays messages,
    help text, and interactive dialogue. For example, if you enter
    **one** or **two** question marks in a field, help is displayed in
    this area.

-   Command Line: Here you can issue the commands **Exit**, **Save**,
    **Close**, **Next Page**, and **Refresh**.

-   Help Reminder: This reminds the user that to get help at any time,
    press **\<PF1\>H**.

Fields are usually composed of a *data element* and a *caption*.
ScreenMan displays data elements in high intensity (**boldface**) and
other text in regular intensity. Text that identifies a data element is
called a *caption* and is usually followed by a colon (**:**). A caption
and its associated data element are together called a *field*. Captions
of *required* fields are [underlined]{.underline}; to save any changes
you make on the form, required fields *must* contain data.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** ScreenMan highlights captions for required
fields with an [underline]{.underline}. However, on some terminals or
depending on your terminal emulator software and your personal
preferences, the form of the highlight can vary (e.g.,Â some terminal
emulators will highlight required fields in a different color, with an
[underline]{.underline}, or both).\
\
Specifically, on Qume 102 and Wyse 75 terminals, captions for required
fields display in **boldface**, *not* underlined. Also, the edit window
is displayed with an [underline]{.underline} extending from the last
character of the existing data to the right edge of the edit window. VA
FileMan supports longer than **24**-line screens for those using
terminal emulators.

## Navigation Keystrokes (Cursor Movement)

### How to Navigate between Fields

There are a number of ways you can move the cursor from field to field
on a form (i.e.,Â navigate). This is to provide you with as much
flexibility as possible so that you can work quickly and efficiently
with forms.

You can use the keystrokes listed in [Table 23]{.underline} to move the
cursor to various fields located on a ScreenMan form:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  To                                  Press
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Move to the next field (to right or **\<Tab\>**
  below).                             

  Move to the previous field (to left **\<PF4\>**
  or above).                          

  Move to the field above.            **\<ArrowUp\>**

  Move to the field below.            **\<ArrowDown\>**

  Move to the next field in the       **\<Enter\>**
  pre-defined edit sequence.          

  Edit a WORD-PROCESSING field.       At field, press **\<Enter\>**

  Select a subrecord in a Multiple.   At field, press **\<Enter\>**

  Move to the next block on current   **\<PF1\>\<PF4\>**
  page.                               

  Jump to a specific field.           **\^** followed by Caption of field
                                      and **\<Enter\>**

  Jump to the Command Line.           **\^\<Enter\>**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  : []{#_Ref345579028 .anchor}Table : ScreenMan---Keystrokes to Navigate
  between Pages in a ScreenMan Form

### How to Navigate between Pages

Many ScreenMan forms have more than one *page* (i.e.,Â there are
additional screens besides the first one on the form) with additional
fields that you can edit.

You can use the keystrokes listed in [Table 24]{.underline} to move
between pages on a ScreenMan form:

+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| To                                | Press                            |

: []{#_Ref345583017 .anchor}Table : ScreenMan---Command Line Options and
Shortcut Keystrokes in a ScreenMan Form

### Saving and Exiting

To **SAVE** or **EXIT** the form, you need to reach ScreenMan's command
line. It's reachable from any ScreenMan screen. To reach the command
line, do any one of the following:

-   Enter a caret (**\^**) at any field prompt.

-   Press **Enter**, **Tab**, or **PF4** to move from field to field
    until you reach the command line.

-   Press the \<**ArrowDown**\> or \<**ArrowUp**\> keys to move the
    cursor from field to field downwards or upwards, until you reach the
    command line.

Then you can enter **SAVE** or **EXIT** at the [command
line](#command-line-options-save-exit-etc.).

### Command Line Options (SAVE, EXIT, etc.)

From the Command Line, you can issue the commands to perform various
functions while in ScreenMan. You can also use a shortcut key sequence
to perform the same function without having to enter it on the command
line.

#### Shortcut Keys

[Table 25]{.underline} lists the command line options and the
corresponding shortcut responses while in a ScreenMan form:

## Editing

### How to Edit Fields

[Table 26]{.underline}, [Table 27]{.underline}, [Table 28]{.underline},
and [Table 29]{.underline} list the key sequences for ScreenMan's Field
Editor; the editor that allows you to edit data fields on a ScreenMan
Form.

#### Cursor Movement

[Table 26]{.underline} lists the keystrokes you use to move the cursor
while in a ScreenMan form:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  To Move                             Press
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Right one character.                **\<ArrowRight\>**

  Left one character.                 **\<ArrowLeft\>**

  Right one word.                     **\<Ctrl-L\>** or
                                      **\<PF1\>\<Spacebar\>**

  Left one word.                      **\<Ctrl-J\>**

  Right edge of window.               **\<PF1\>\<ArrowRight\>**

  Left edge of window.                **\<PF1\>\<ArrowLeft\>**

#### Deletion

[Table 27]{.underline} lists the keystrokes you use to delete characters
while in a ScreenMan form:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  To Delete                           Press
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Character under cursor.             **\<PF2\>** or **\<Delete\>** or

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  : []{#_Ref345583068 .anchor}Table : ScreenMan---Keystrokes to Switch
  Modes in a ScreenMan Form

#### Modes

[Table 28]{.underline} lists the keystrokes you use to switch modes
while in a ScreenMan form:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  To Switch to                        Press
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Insert/Replace mode.                **\<PF3\>**

  Zoom editor (edit long fields).     **\<PF1\>Z**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  : []{#_Ref345583086 .anchor}Table : ScreenMan---Keystrokes to Navigate
  Repeating Blocks in a ScreenMan Form

If the first key you press upon navigating to a field is a printable
character, the Field Editor assumes you want to replace any existing
default and replaces the entire field with the character just typed. To
just edit the existing field value, first press an editing key, such as
**\<ArrowLeft\>** or **\<ArrowRight\>**.

### Long Fields (and the Zoom Editor)

The actual contents of a field being edited can extend beyond the
confines of the visible field on a ScreenMan form. As you use the
**\<ArrowLeft\>** and **\<ArrowRight\>** keys at the left and right
edges of the window, you can scroll left or right to display one end or
the other of the field.

To see and edit the entire contents of a long field at once, press
**\<PF1\>Z** to invoke the Zoom Editor. This opens an area up at the
bottom of the screen, providing you as much space as you need to both
see and edit the entire long field.

### WORD-PROCESSING Fields

To edit or display a WORD-PROCESSING field, press the **Enter** key at
the WORD-PROCESSING field. This clears the screen and passes control to
your Preferred Editor to edit the field. If you do *not* have a
Preferred Editor, the [Screen Editor]{.underline} is used. When you exit
the editor, you return to the ScreenMan screen.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** To set your Preferred Editor, see the
"[Choosing a Preferred Editor]{.underline}" section.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE**: If the WORD-PROCESSING field is uneditable
or appears in a display block, you can view the contents of the field
with an editor. However, if you edit the text, your changes are *not*
filed in the permanent database, even if you tell the editor to save the
changes. A plus sign (**+**) in a ScreenMan form indicates whether a
WORD-PROCESSING field already contains data. If users have their
PREFERRED EDITOR field set to **SCREEN EDITOR -- VA FILEMAN**, the
previous message "**No existing Text**" has been modified to "**THERE
ARE NO LINES!**" if a WORD-PROCESSING field has no data.

### Multiples

You can easily spot a Multiple field. It usually begins with the word
"Select" (as in "Select ADDRESS" or "Select ADMISSION DATE"). There are
two ways Multiples can be displayed on a form:

-   The Multiple is linked to a "popup" subpage, which contains the
    subfields of the Multiple.

-   The Multiple is displayed in a repeating block---several subrecords
    can be displayed simultaneously on a page, much like a scrolling
    list and the Multiples within a single SreenMan page can be more
    than one line deep.

#### Multiples Linked to "Popup" Subpages

A Multiple field can appear on a page and be linked to a regular or
"popup" subpage. When you navigate to the Multiple field, select a
subrecord, and press **Enter**, you are taken to the subpage that
contains the fields within the Multiple.

In [Figure 101]{.underline}, the Multiple is the field with the caption
"Select SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS:". When you enter a secondary menu option
at this field, you are taken into a "popup" subpage, where you can edit
the fields for that particular subrecord:

In this example, the popup subpage displays when an entry was made at
the "Select SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS" prompt. The user can edit the
selected entry for the Multiple in this popup subpage.

#### Exiting a Subpage

While in a subpage, your only Command Line options are
[**C****LOSE**](#_Hlt446227361) and [**RE****FRESH**](#_Hlt446227363).
You *cannot* [**E****XIT**](#_Hlt446227366), [**Quit**](\l), or
[**SA****VE**](#_Hlt446227371) until you return to the parent page. You
can return to the parent page by pressing **\<PF1\>C** or issuing the
[**C****LOSE**](#_Hlt446227361) command at the Command Line. From there,
you can select another subrecord to edit or navigate to another field.

#### Deleting an Entry in a Multiple

If a default subrecord is displayed at a Multiple field, you can delete
that subrecord by entering an at-sign (**@**) at the Multiple field. You
can also delete a specific subrecord by selecting that subrecord and
going into the subpage and entering an at-sign (**@**) at the **.01**
field.

![Caution](output/images/media/image4.png){width="0.4479166666666667in"
height="0.4479166666666667in"} CAUTION: Deletions of subrecords are
immediate and permanent; even if you quit the form without saving,
deleted subrecords are *not* restored to the database.

#### Adding a New Entry to a Multiple

You can respond to a Multiple field in one of two ways:

-   Accept the field's default answer.

-   Enter a new item: an employee's second address, for example, or
    another admission date for the same patient.

To enter a new entry in a Multiple, enter the new value for the new
entry in the Multiple's **.01** field. If you have **LAYGO** access
(permission to add new entries), you are asked if you want to add the
entry to the Multiple. To change your mind about adding the item, enter
**NO**. If you enter **YES**, though, ScreenMan opens either a "popup"
page or a new window, allowing you to enter additional information for
the new Multiple entry.

#### Multiples in Repeating Blocks

Subrecords in a Multiple can be displayed in another way. Rather than
just the name of single entry in the Multiple being displayed on the
current page, you can also see Multiples where several subrecords are
displayed simultaneously on the page. Each subrecord occupies one line
on the screen, in a scrolling list. This is called a repeating block.
Instead of leading to a "popup" page, you can edit all visible fields in
the Multiple as they are displayed.

For example:

In this example, the employment data is the Repeated Block for the
Multiple. There are **four** entries in the Multiple that are visible.
The plus sign (**+**) indicates more records exist in the list above.

You can always navigate to a blank line below the end of the list. At
this blank line, you can add a new subrecord if **LAYGO** is allowed or
jump to an existing subrecord by entering its name.

## Details

### How to File Edits

In general, the database is unaffected while you edit a record in a
ScreenMan form. Changes are filed only at your request, when you
[**S****AVE**](#_Hlt446227371) or [**E****XIT**](#_Hlt446227366).

Before filing, ScreenMan checks that:

-   Required fields on all pages that can be accessed via the **Next**
    and **Previous** page links have values, even if you have *not*
    accessed those pages during the editing session.

-   If you have accessed any subpages, required fields in those subpages
    *must* also have values.

If any required field is empty, you *cannot* file any data changes. When
you attempt to file, ScreenMan displays a list of those fields that
require values.

The **\<PF1\>Q** key sequence allows you to [**Quit**](#_Hlt446227368)
the form without saving changes. Filing does *not* occur if you time
out.

![Caution](output/images/media/image4.png){width="0.4479166666666667in"
height="0.4479166666666667in"} CAUTION: There is one situation in which
a change to the database is made immediately: when you delete an entry
from a file or subfile. When you attempt to delete an entry, ScreenMan
issues a warning that deletions are immediate and permanent. Even if you
[Quit](#_Hlt446227368) the form without [saving](#_Hlt446227371) your
changes, the entry is *not* restored to the database.

### Troubleshooting

While screen displays offer many advantages, they also require that the
software can correctly identify the type of terminal being used or
emulated. An incorrect identification may produce unreadable and
unusable screens. To exit such a screen, enter
**\^\<Enter\>\^\<Enter\>**.

If you continue to find the screens are unreadable, check the following
sources for troubleshooting information:

-   "System Management" section in the *VA FileMan Advanced User Manual*
    (e.g.,Â the "Device Handling for Standalone VA FileMan" section).

-   *Kernel 8.0 & Kernel Toolkit 7.3 Systems Management Guide* (look for
    information on "Device Type at Signon" and changing your terminal
    type).

-   Systems Administrator.

# Word-Processing Fields

## Word-Processing Editors

WORD-PROCESSING-type fields are typically used so that you can write,
edit, and format text for letters and reports, text information in
patient records, electronic MailMan messages, application packages,
responses, and so on.

VA FileMan provides two editors for WORD-PROCESSING fields:

-   [Line Editor]{.underline}

-   [Screen Editor]{.underline}

The system manager can provide other editors as well (e.g., Extensible
Editor).

You can select any of the available editors on the system as your
Preferred Editor. If you select a Preferred Editor that editor is used
whenever you edit a WORD-PROCESSING field. If you *do not* choose a
Preferred Editor, the following defaults are used:

-   [Line Editor]{.underline}**---**When editing WORD-PROCESSING fields
    from Scrolling Mode.

-   [Screen Editor]{.underline}**---**When editing WORD-PROCESSING
    fields from a ScreenMan form.

## Choosing a Preferred Editor

To select your preferred editor, perform the following procedure:

1.  At any menu prompt, enter "**TBOX**\" to go to the **User's
    Toolbox** \[XUSERTOOLS\] menu.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
24. From the **User's Toolbox** \[XUSERTOOLS\] menu, choose the **Edit
    User Characteristics** \[XUSEREDITSELF\] option.

25. At the "Select TERMINAL TYPE NAME:\" prompt, you can usually just
    accept the default by pressing the **Enter** key.

26. You are now placed in a ScreenMan form where you can edit your user
    characteristics. Press **\<ArrowDown\>** until your cursor arrives
    at the "PREFERRED EDITOR:" prompt.

27. At the "PREFERRED EDITOR:" prompt, you can choose your Preferred
    Editor. Enter **two** question marks (**??**) to get a list of the
    available editors on your system. Choose one as your Preferred
    Editor and then press the **Enter** key. The Screen Editor is
    usually a good choice.

28. Press **\<PF1\>E** to exit the [ScreenMan]{.underline} form. If you
    are asked whether to save changes before leaving the form, answer
    **YES**.

Your Preferred Editor should now be set to the editor you have chosen.
This is the editor that is used whenever you edit the contents of a
WORD-PROCESSING field.

## Switching to another Editor While Editing

Selecting your default editor determines which editor is used whenever
you edit a WORD-PROCESSING field. However, if you want to *temporarily*
switch to another editor once you have started editing, both the Screen
Editor and the Line Editor allow you to do this:

-   In the [Screen Editor]{.underline}:

1.  Press **\<PF1\>A**.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
29. Choose the editor to which you wish to switch.

-   In the [Line Editor]{.underline}:

1.  Choose the **Utilities in Word-processing** option.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
30. At the "Edit Option:" prompt, choose **Editor Change**.

31. Choose the editor to which you wish to switch.

the Line Editor, see the "[Line Editor]{.underline}" section.

# Screen Editor

To edit the contents of DATA TYPE field values of WORD-PROCESSING in
files, you need to use a word-processing editor. VA FileMan provides two
standard editors:

-   Screen Editor

-   [Line Editor]{.underline}

The Screen Editor provides flexibility and freedom *not* provided by the
[Line Editor]{.underline}. The Screen Editor provides such features as
the following:

-   Full-screen editing

-   Automatic text wrapping

-   Search-and-replace

In most cases, you would want your default editor to be the Screen
Editor.

For most people, the Screen Editor should be your Preferred Editor for
WORD-PROCESSING fields.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** To set your default editor, see the
"[Choosing a Preferred Editor]{.underline}" section. This section also
explains how you can switch your current editor on-the-fly.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information on the Line Editor, see
the "[Line Editor]{.underline}" section.

If you enter **\<PF1\>H** at any time in the Screen Editor, you can get
online help that lists all the available commands.

At any time, while entering text using the Screen Editor, you can select
a command. For example, at any time you can change your left margin,
move to a different screen, save your document, or get online help. To
invoke most commands, you need to enter only two keystrokes: the
**\<PF1\>** key and a character key, such as **D** for delete line.

You usually find the **\<PF\>** keys at the top or right-hand side of
your terminal keyboard, along with the numeric keypad. If you are using
a personal computer rather than a computer terminal, the **\<PF\>** keys
are mostly likely re-mapped to another set of keys (consult your system
administrator to find out to what keys the **\<PF1\>** through
**\<PF4\>** are re-mapped).

## Screen Editor Screen

The Screen Editor display consists of a status bar at the top and a
ruler at the bottom. Between the two status bars is the area where you
create and edit text, as shown in [Figure 103]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref345588527 .anchor}Figure : Screen Editor---Sample
WORD-PROCESSING Field in the Screen Editor: Sample Component Parts

==\[ WRAP \]==\[ INSERT \]============\< FIELD NAME \>============\[
\<PF1\>H=Help \]====

\<=======T=======T=======T=======T=======T=======T=======T=======T=======T\>======

Scr 1 of 52 Ln 1 of 97 Col 1

## Entering Text

When using the Screen Editor, you type your text as you normally would.
As you type, the Screen Editor automatically wraps lines of text to fit
within the left and right margins. There is no need to press the
**Enter** key at the end of each line. The Screen Editor accepts any
printable characters as keyboard input. However, it *cannot* be used to
edit text that contains control characters.

## Entering Commands

Editor commands are invoked using keyboard command sequences. The Screen
Editor makes use of the **\<PF\>** keys, the cursor keypad, and, if
available on the keyboard, the edit keypad to perform its editing
functions.

## Navigation Keystrokes (Cursor Movement)

[Table 30]{.underline} lists the keystrokes you use to navigate while in
the Screen Editor:

: []{#_Ref345576275 .anchor}Table : Screen Editor---Keystrokes to Exit
and Save Text in the Screen Editor

You can *move forward quickly across a line* by pressing the **Tab** key
(**\<Tab\>**). The **Tab** key in the Screen Editor does *not* insert
anything into the text. The **Tab** key is for navigation only and
simply moves the cursor to the next tab stop to the right. Another way
to move across a line, either forward or backward, is to move a word at
a time, using **\<Ctrl\>J** or **\<Ctrl\>L**.

## Saving, Printing, and Exiting

text while in the Screen Editor:

: []{#_Ref345576495 .anchor}Table : Screen Editor---Keystrokes to Find
Text in the Screen Editor

If your editing session ends unexpectedly because of hardware failure or
another reason that prevents normal exiting, any changes you have made
in the current WORD-PROCESSING field *are not* saved. On the other hand,
if you time out when editing text, your changes *are* saved.

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal Type Setting

The Screen Editor is designed for use on all terminal types known in the
Kernel computing environment. It is very important that your terminal
type be correctly identified to VA FileMan.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** For more information about how terminal
types are identified, see the Kernel documentation located on the VDL:
<https://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=10>

Since the **\<PF\>** keys are used in the Screen Editor, those keys
should *not* be reprogrammed.

### \<PF\> Keys Not Working: How to Exit

If your **\<PF\>** keys do *not* work in the Screen Editor, your
terminal type is probably set incorrectly. Before you can correct the
setting, you need to make an emergency exit from the editor by using one
of the following keystroke combinations:

-   Press **\<Esc\>OPQ** (if your keyboard has an **Escape \[Esc\]**
    key).

-   Press **\<Ctrl\>\[OPQ** (if your keyboard does *not* have an
    **Escape\[Esc\]** key).

-   Press **\<Ctrl\>A@\<Enter\>Q** (if *neither* of the above methods
    work).

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** You *must* enter all letters in the above
key sequences in *uppercase*.

## Screen Editor and Personal Computers

### Pasting and Uploading

If you are accessing your computer system from a personal computer (PC),
you can *paste* text from an application on the PC into the Screen
Editor, and also *upload* files into the Screen Editor. There are some
issues to be aware of when pasting text or uploading files into the
Screen Editor.

### Symbol Characters

Extended ASCII characters (typically "symbol" characters) *cannot* be
stored in WORD-PROCESSING fields. Examples of such characters include:

-   "Smart Quote" characters

-   Bullets

-   Symbols

Such characters, when encountered, are stripped or replaced with a
**space**, **'**, **"**, or **\***, as appropriate. To avoid problems
uploading these types of characters, you should:

-   Turn off "Smart Quotes" in your word-processor on your personal
    computer.

-   Avoid using bullets.

-   Avoid using symbols in your text such as: **Â¼**, **Â½** , and **Âº**.

### Files: Save as Text

If you are uploading an entire word-processing document (as opposed to
pasting), save it first as a "Text Only with Line Breaks" (or similar)
file type in your personal computer word-processor.

### Wrap Vs. No Wrap

If your source document contains a carriage return at the end of every
line, turn **WRAP** off in the Screen Editor *before* you paste or
upload by pressing **PF2**. Turn it back on once the paste or upload is
completed. If your source document contains a carriage return at the end
of each paragraph only; however, leave **WRAP** on in the Screen Editor.

### Avoiding Lost Characters

If the host computer system *cannot* keep up with the text upload,
characters can get "lost." This can be a factor if you upload large
quantities of text or characters. This character loss can occur because
pastes and ASCII uploads do *not* use *error*-correcting communications
protocols.

If you notice characters getting lost, one way to solve this is to
adjust the "character pacing" (or similar) setting in your terminal
emulation program. This can slow down the transfer of text such that
characters no longer get lost due to communications overload.

If you need to paste or upload large quantities of text, consider
switching to an Alternate Editor (e.g.,Â Kermit) that uses an
*error*-correcting communications protocol. This automatically
compensates for communications overflows, preventing the loss of
characters during text transfer.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** To use Kermit, it *must* be installed as an
Alternate Editor at your site.

# Line Editor

The Line Editor is a scrolling mode editor. It is the second of two
standard editors VA FileMan provides for editing WORD-PROCESSING-type
fields. The distinguishing characteristic of a Scrolling Mode editor is
that you enter your text one line at a time, and that you can only edit
lines one at a time. Because word-processing in a scrolling mode
interface can be cumbersome, you can set your Preferred Editor to the
[Screen Editor]{.underline}. VA FileMan continues to provide the
Scrolling-Mode Line Editor, however, for those who prefer it.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** To set your default editor, see the
"[Choosing a Preferred Editor]{.underline}" section.\
\
**NOTE:** For most people, the [Screen Editor]{.underline} should be
your Preferred Editor for WORD-PROCESSING fields.

## Recognizing the Line Editor

When you edit a WORD-PROCESSING field, it's easy to see if VA FileMan
chooses the Line Editor as your editor. If the Line Editor is used, the
last **nine** lines of text (if there are that many) are displayed on
the screen, with numbered prompts at the start of each line. Also, after
the text is listed, you are prompted with "EDIT Option:". The "EDIT
Option:" prompt is where you can enter each Line Editor command to work
with the text.

For example:

[]{#_Toc527389309 .anchor}Figure : Line Editor---Example of a
WORD-PROCESSING Field in the Line Editor

HISTORY:

1\>Owing to poverty in early youth, patient seems not to

2\>have had proper diet. Since achieving economic success,

3\>his diet has been adequate, but traces of original

4\>deficiency remain.

5\>

EDIT Option:

## How to Enter Text in the Line Editor

If no text exists yet in a WORD-PROCESSING field that you are about to
edit, you see the field name followed by "**1\>**". This is the Line
Editor's prompt for entering word-processing text.

For example:

[]{#_Toc527389310 .anchor}Figure : Line Editor---Prompts for Entering
Word-Processing Text

Select PATIENT FILE NAME: **FMPATIENT,FOUR**

Select DIAGNOSIS: ANGINA PECTORIS// **B-12 DEFICIENCY**

HISTORY:

1\>

You can now enter the text for Line **1** and press the **Enter** key.
This brings you to a prompt "**2\>**" for Line **2**, and so forth. Keep
adding lines until you are done; then, press the **Enter** key on a
blank line to finish your edit, as shown in [Figure 107]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref523922313 .anchor}Figure : Line Editor---Completing Your Edits

HISTORY:

1\>**Owing to poverty in early youth, patient seems not to\<Enter\>**

2\>**have had proper diet. Since achieving economic success,\<Enter\>**

3\>**his diet has been adequate, but traces of original\<Enter\>**

4\>**deficiency remain.\<Enter\>**

5\>**\<Enter\>**

EDIT Option: **\<Enter\>**

Select DIAGNOSIS:

## Revising Existing Text

To revise the contents of the WORD-PROCESSING field, you need to call up
each individual line that you want to edit and then edit each line.

To revise existing text, perform the following procedure:

1.  At the "EDIT Option:" prompt, enter the letter **E** for Edit a Line
    (Replace \_\_ With \_\_).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
36. At the "Edit line:" prompt, enter the number of the line you need to
    revise.

37. Beneath the "EDIT Option:" and "Edit line:" prompts, you see the
    line of text that you identified by number and you see the "Replace"
    prompt.

38. Enter a string in the current line to be replaced.

39. If the string you enter is found in the current line, set the "With"
    prompt. Enter a string to replace the original string.

40. The line is now updated, and you are prompted for another string to
    replace. If you are done editing the line, simply press the
    **Enter** key.

### Shortcut: Enter Line Number to Edit at "EDIT Option:" Prompt

There's a shortcut to edit a particular line. At the "EDIT Option:"
prompt, instead of choosing the Edit a Line (Replace \_\_ With \_\_)
option and entering the line number, just enter the line number instead.
You are taken directly to the line you specify, and then given the
"Replace" prompt to edit the line:

[]{#_Toc527389312 .anchor}Figure : Line Editor---Shortcut to Edit a
Specific Line Using the Line Editor

EDIT Option: **5**

was the time of the day that I went over to Building 8 and

Edit line:

## "Replace\...With" Edits: Be Careful

When editing individual lines, you make changes using the
"Replace\...With" dialogue, where you enter an existing string in the
line, and a new string with which to replace it. Be careful as you enter
your responses to the "Replace" and "With" prompts. Enter enough letters
to ensure that the computer replaces the desired string of characters.

Here is why this issue is so important. In one line, you may have two
identical words, or you may have two identical sets of characters
embedded. Since the computer changes only the ***first*** occurrence of
any series of letters that you enter, review your line carefully before
responding to the "Replace" prompt. Then enter enough identifying
characters to correct *the specific word or characters* you wish to
change. To illustrate the point, look at an ***incorrect*** entry
([Figure 109]{.underline}).

In [Figure 109]{.underline}, you need to change the sentence in the
second line from "This example is sample" to the sentence "This example
is simple."

[]{#_Ref523927459 .anchor}Figure : Line Editor---Example of an
*Incorrect* Edit with the "Replace\...With" Editor

EDIT Option: **2**

2\>This example is sample

Replace **ample** With **imple** Replace **\<Enter\>**

This eximple is sample

Edit line:

As you can see from this example, VA FileMan replaced the ***first***
occurrence of the "**ample**" characters. Thus, "**example**" was
changed to "**eximple**" rather than "**sample**" being changed to
"**simple**" because the word "**example**" came before the word
"**simple**" in the sentence (i.e.,Â it was the first occurrence).
Obviously, we should have replaced the whole word "**sample**" with
"**simple**" to avoid any confusion.

### Shortcuts at the "Replace\...With" Prompt

As with editing long field values, you can replace long strings of
characters by using ellipses. An ellipsis is **three** successive
periods (**\...**). When editing, you can replace longer strings of
characters by using an ellipsis at the "Replace" prompt. You can specify
ranges of text to replace for any line (just as with a long text field)
with the ellipsis.

For example, to replace an entire line at a "Replace\...With" prompt,
enter the ellipsis (three periods) at the "Replace" prompt. You are then
able to replace the entire default with what you entered at the "With"
prompt, as shown in [Figure 110]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref523927771 .anchor}Figure : Line Editor---Using the Ellipsis

"Replace\...With" editor:

WORD-PROCESSING field and would now like to review the entire text.
After entering text on Line **4** (**4\>**), press the **Enter** key.
When prompted for Line **5** (**5\>**), press the **Enter** key again
and you arrive at the "EDIT Option:" prompt. Enter **L** (for List a
Range of Lines option) and choose the range of lines to list (in this
case, Lines **1** to **4**):

[]{#_Toc527389316 .anchor}Figure : Line Editor---Example Using the List

3\>his diet has been adequate, but traces of original

4\>deficiency remain.

EDIT Option:

### ADD: Append More Text

After listing lines of text (see "[LIST: List the
Message](#list-list-the-message)" section), suppose you need to add a
few comments at the end of your message. From the "EDIT Option:" prompt,
enter **A** (for Add Lines to End of Text option). You can now add
additional lines:

[]{#_Toc527389317 .anchor}Figure : Line Editor---Example Using the Add
Lines to End of Text Option

7\> **\<Enter\>**

### JOIN: Combine Two Lines of Text

Suppose you are at the "EDIT Option:" prompt. After briefly reviewing
your text, you have decided that Lines **2** and **3** (**2\>** and
**3\>**) are too short. You can use the **Join** command (i.e.,Â Join
Line to the One Following option) to join Line **2** to the next line:

[]{#_Toc527389318 .anchor}Figure : Line Editor---Example Using the Join
Line to the One Following Option

EDIT Option: **L \<Enter\>** ist line: 2// **\<Enter\>** to: 3//

2\>left by

3\>the doorway.

EDIT Option: **J \<Enter\>** oin line: **2**

2\>left by the doorway.

..

EDIT Option:

### INSERT: Insert New Lines of Text between Existing Ones

Suppose that you want to insert new lines of text in the middle of
existing text in a WORD-PROCESSING field. Using the [Add Lines to End of
Text](#Add) does *not* work, because that appends new text lines at the
*end* of the existing lines. Instead, you can use the **Insert** command
\[i.e.,Â Insert Lines after an Existing Line option\], to do this:

[]{#_Toc527389319 .anchor}Figure : Line Editor---Example Using the
Insert Lines after an Existing Line Option

EDIT Option: **L \<Enter\>** ist line: 1// **\<Enter\>** to: 5//
**\<Enter\>**

2\>by the doorway.

3\>We have some work ahead of us now.

EDIT Option: **I \<Enter\>** nsert after line: **2**

3\> **\<Enter\>**

4\> **Finally, the order arrived! \<Enter\>**

5\> **\<Enter\>**

### DELETE: Delete a Line or Lines

To delete lines of text in a WORD-PROCESSING field, use the **Delete**
command \[i.e.,Â Delete Line(s) option\] at the "EDIT Option:" prompt, as
shown in [Figure 116]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref523929212 .anchor}Figure : Line Editor---Example Using the
Delete Line(s) Option

EDIT Option: **D \<Enter\>** elete from line: **5 \<Enter\>** thru: 3//

## Advanced Features

Most of the features of the Line Editor are self-explanatory and simple
to use. However, a few require additional explanation, as follows in
this section.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** To see a full list of the commands
available at the "EDIT Option:" prompt, enter two question marks
(**??**), as shown in [Figure 111]{.underline}.

### File Transfer (Use When Uploading ASCII Text)

The **File Transfer from Foreign CPU** option from the **Utility** menu
lets you upload text from another system into your WORD-PROCESSING field
text, using an ASCII (*non-error*-correcting) transfer. For example, if
you are connected from a personal computer (PC), you can use your
communication software to send a text file.

The file to be transferred *must* be a text (pure ASCII) file. Most
word-processing programs have a way of saving a document as text
(i.e.,Â without special formatting information); check your
word-processor's manual. Also, you need to know how to send a text file
using your PC's communication software; if you are not sure how, check
your communications software manual.

To use the **File Transfer from Foreign CPU** option, perform the
following procedure:

1.  Make sure the file you are transferring is a pure ASCII text file.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
41. While editing a WORD-PROCESSING field in the Line Editor, choose the
    **Utility** menu option at the "EDIT Option:" prompt. Then choose
    the **File Transfer from Foreign CPU** option from the **Utility**
    menu.

42. At the "MAXIMUM string length? : (3-245):" prompt, enter maximum
    string length for lines you are uploading.

43. The Line Editor now waits up to **30** seconds for you to initiate
    an ASCII transfer of the file.

44. Use your communications software to perform an ASCII upload of the
    file. All uploaded text is appended to the WORD-PROCESSING field
    that you are editing.

45. Once you have finished uploading, it takes **30** seconds of
    inactivity until the transfer can complete. When done, and after
    **30** seconds of inactivity, the computer responds "FILE TRANSFER
    COMPLETE" and you are returned to the "EDIT Option:" prompt.

The same precautions apply for uploading large quantities of text to the
Line Editor as apply with the [Screen Editor]{.underline}. In
particular, if you need to upload large quantities of text quickly,
consider switching to an Alternate Editor, such as Kermit (if installed
as an Alternate Editor by your site), which provides *error*-correcting
communications protocol. Unlike an ASCII transfer (used with the **File
Transfer** option), an error-correcting protocol (e.g.,Â Kermit) can
transfer text and automatically compensate for any communications
overflows, without losing characters.

### Text Terminator-String Change

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **NOTE:** Use this when uploading text with blank
lines.

In the Line Editor, a blank line (**NULL** string) signals the end of
data entry (and returns you to the "EDIT Option:" prompt. Thus, if you
plan to *paste* or *upload* text into the Line Editor from a personal
computer, any blank lines in the uploaded text have the side-effect of
signaling the end of data entry (prematurely). One way around this is to
use the [File Transfer from Foreign CPU
option](#file-transfer-use-when-uploading-ascii-text). Another way
around this problem is to use the **Text-Terminator-String Change**
option on the **Utility** menu. This lets you change the text terminator
so that some character string, rather than a blank line, is what is used
to signal the end of data entry.

You can change the text terminator to any string of between **one** and
**five** characters; question marks (**?**) or carets (**\^**) are *not*
allowed in the string. To finish editing a WORD-PROCESSING field and get
to the "EDIT Option:" prompt, simply enter your new text terminator
string instead of pressing the **Enter** key on a blank line. You should
choose a text terminator that does *not* appear in your text: "**end**"
would *not* be a good choice, but "**EnD**" might be.

The new text terminator is *not permanent*; it remains only as long as
you are editing a particular WORD-PROCESSING field. You can change it
back to a **NULL** line by entering an at-sign (**@**) at the
"Text-Terminator:" prompt. You can permanently change your default text
terminator by changing it in your user characteristics as described in
the Kernel manuals.

### Programmer Edit (Edit Lines with M Commands)

The **Y-Programmer Edit** option (invoked by entering the letter **Y**)
is only available to users with programmer's access. You can enter a
line of M code that, line-by-line, reads in the current line in variable
**X** and returns the transformed line in variable **Y**. You can
specify the range of lines to be transformed by the M code you enter.

For example, to blank out all lines containing the words "**Top
Secret**", you could enter the following M code:

[]{#_Toc527389321 .anchor}Figure : Line Editor---Example of Entering M
Code while Using the Y-Programmer Edit Option

EDIT Option: **Y**

The text is in X and returned in Y

Enter MUMPS xecute string to do transformation: **I X\["Top Secret" S
Y=" "**

### Editor Change: Switch Editors

The **Editor Change** option, on the **Utility** menu, shows you a list
of the editors available for your use, if you enter **two** question
marks (**??**) at the "Select ALTERNATE EDITOR:" prompt. The editors
include VA FileMan's own editors (the Line Editor and Screen Editor) and
any other editors to which you have access. You choose the editor to use
by entering its name. When you exit your chosen editor, you return to
the Line Editor's "EDIT option:" prompt.

### Transfer Text (from another WORD-PROCESSING Field)

The **Transfer Lines From Another Document** option lets you copy text
from some other WORD-PROCESSING field into your current field. You need
to specify on which line of the current field to place the incoming text
and identify the source of the text.

To identify the source of the text, you need to use extended pointer
syntax.

![Note](output/images/media/image2.png){width="0.3125in"
height="0.3125in"} **REF:** The extended pointer syntax is described in
the "Relational Navigation" section in the *VA FileMan Advanced User
Manual*.

The syntax lets you specify the particular field of a specific entry in
a specific file. Briefly, the syntax can be in one of the following two
forms:

\<*expression*\>:\<*file*\>:\<*field*\>

**Or**

\<*expression*\> IN \<*file*\> FILE:\<*field*\>

The **\<*expression*\>** or lookup value has several possible forms. One
way to refer to the field is by entry name. To retrieve text from the
WORD-PROCESSING PROGNOSIS field of the entry **Angina Pectoris** in a
(fictitious) file named DIAGNOSES, you could enter the following, as
shown in [Figure 118]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref523930871 .anchor}Figure : Line Editor---Dialogue of the
Extended Pointer Syntax while Using the Transfer Lines From Another
Document Option: Sample User Entries at Prompts (Example #1)

EDIT Option: **T \<Enter\>** ransfer incoming text after line: **1**

From what text: **?**

Select another entry in this file, OR

use relational syntax to pick up information from a word-

processing field in another file.

ex. "VALUE":FILE NAME:WORD PROCESSING FIELD NAME

Do you want the entire TEST list?

Enter Yes or No: **\^**

From what text: **"Angina Pectoris":DIAGNOSES:PROGNOSIS**

From line: **1 \<Enter\>** thru: **20**

ARE YOU SURE? NO// **Y \<Enter\>** (YES)\... . .

Alternately, you can use the second syntax to retrieve the same field in
the same file entry, as shown in [Figure 119]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref345588550 .anchor}Figure : Line Editor---Dialogue of the
Extended Pointer Syntax while Using the Transfer Lines From Another
Document Option: Sample User Entries at Prompts (Example #2)

EDIT Option: **T \<Enter\>** ransfer incoming text after line: **4**

From what text: **"Angina Pectoris" IN DIAGNOSIS FILE:PROGNOSIS**

From line: **1 \<Enter\>** thru: **20**

ARE YOU SURE? NO// **Y \<Enter\>** (YES) \...

In this example, at the \"From what text:\" prompt:

-   \"**Angina Pectoris**\" is the entry name.

-   **DIAGNOSIS** is the file name.

-   **Prognosis** is the field name.

The requested text is identified by the value of the **.01** field in
quotes ("**Angina Pectoris**"). Thus, in this example the
***\<expression\>*** is the entry's name. You also specify which lines
you want to transfer. If you enter **one** question mark (**?**) at the
"From line:" prompt, you can list the current numbered lines in the
WORD-PROCESSING field. You can then easily choose the lines to be
transferred.

If the field from which you are transferring text displays text without
wrapping, you receive the message shown in [Figure 120]{.underline}:

[]{#_Ref389661772 .anchor}Figure : Line Editor---Example of a Possible
Warning Message when Using the Transfer Lines From Another Document
Option

WARNING!

The field you are transferring text from displays text without wrapping.

The field you are transferring text into may display text differently.

Do you want to continue?

Enter Yes or No:

Consider the possibility that the text transferred from the no-wrap
field may be unreadable, if the field you are transferring into does
wrap text. For example, a spreadsheet might lose the alignment of its
columns.

If the transfer does *not* succeed, the message **\<no change\>** is
shown. The transfer might fail for several reasons:

-   Incorrect syntax for the extended pointer.

-   An attempted transfer from other than a WORD-PROCESSING field type.

-   Lack of permission to read the file from which you are trying to
    extract text.

You *must* have **READ** access to transfer text from a file.
